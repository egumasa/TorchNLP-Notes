Objective: To examine these associations in the Framingham Heart Study. Design: Prospective and observational. Setting: Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort. Measurements: The exposure marker was red blood cell levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (the Omega-3 Index) measured at baseline. Outcomes included mortality (total, CVD, cancer, and other) and total CVD events in participants free of CVD at baseline. Follow-up was for a median of 7.3 years. Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for 18 variables (demographic, clinical status, therapeutic, and CVD risk factors). Results: Among the 2500 participants (mean age 66 years, 54% women), there were 350 deaths (58 from CVD, 146 from cancer, 128 from other known causes, and 18 from unknown causes). There were 245 CVD events. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, a higher Omega-3 Index was associated with significantly lower risks (P-values for trends across quintiles) for total mortality (P =.02), for non-CVD and non-cancer mortality (P =.009), and for total CVD events (P =.008). Those in the highest (>6.8%) compared to those in the lowest Omega-3 Index quintiles (<4.2%) had a 34% lower risk for death from any cause and 39% lower risk for incident CVD. These associations were generally stronger for docosahexaenoic acid than for eicosapentaenoic acid. When total cholesterol was compared with the Omega-3 Index in the same models, the latter was significantly related with these outcomes, but the former was not. Limitations: Relatively short follow-up time and one-time exposure assessment. Conclusions: A higher Omega-3 Index was associated with reduced risk of both CVD and all-cause mortality.'\n","'>>> body_text: Several recent studies have linked higher blood levels and/or dietary intakes of the long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with greater longevity. Plasma phospholipid n-3 PUFA levels were inversely associated with total mortality rates in the Cardiovascular Health Study,1 and similar associations were seen for this endpoint with the red blood cell (RBC) content of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the Heart and Soul Study.2 This latter metric, called for simplicity the Omega-3 Index, has been proposed as a risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease (CVD).3,4 Consistent with these observations, there is an inverse relationship between the Omega-3 Index and the rate of telomere attrition, a marker of cellular aging.5 Although early randomized controlled trials with n-3 PUFAs found reduced overall mortality,6,7 other more recent studies8–11 have not confirmed such a protective effect. Some of the potential reasons why recent studies may have yielded null results for intervention with n-3 PUFAs (background use of statins,12 short follow-up periods, low n-3 PUFA doses, improvements in acute care, etc.) have been reviewed.13,14 In the present investigation, we examined the relations between RBC n-3 PUFA levels in participants in the Framingham Heart Study's (FHS's) Offspring cohort and total mortality as the primary endpoint, with secondary endpoints of death from CVD and other causes, and of incident coronary heart disease (CHD), CVD, and ischemic stroke. The FHS is a longitudinal community-based cohort study that was initiated in 1948. Adult children of the original cohort were recruited in 1971 into the Framingham Offspring Cohort. The selection criteria for this cohort (and for the more racially diverse Framingham Omni Cohort) have previously been described.15,16 We evaluated Framingham Offspring/Omni participants (n = 3021) who attended their 8th/3rd examination cycles (2005–2008). Participants were excluded in hierarchical order if they were missing RBC FA measurements or relevant clinical covariates (n = 122), leaving 2899. We also excluded 399 with a history of CVD (ie, nonfatal CHD or stroke), leaving 2500 for the present investigation. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Boston University Medical Center. Informed consent was provided by all participants. We considered 18 primary baseline demographic and CV risk covariates: sex, age, body mass index, marital status, education level, employment status, health insurance status, regular aspirin user, prevalent hypertensive status, use of cholesterol-lowering drugs, prevalent diabetes, history of CVD, alcohol consumption, smoking status, physical activity (in metabolic equivalent units), the total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, systolic blood pressure, and C-reactive protein. Four mortality endpoints were examined: total, CVD [fatal myocardial infarction (MI), CHD death, sudden cardiac death, fatal ischemic stroke, or other CVD death), cancer, and other (ie, non-CVD, non-cancer; Note that in the Framingham Heart Study, “other” causes of death were not specifically identified]. Incident CVD-related endpoints were also examined: total CVD (total stroke, total CHD, or CVD mortality), total stroke (any fatal or nonfatal ischemic stroke), and total CHD (fatal or nonfatal MI, CHD death or sudden cardiac death). Blood was drawn after a 10- to 12-hour fast into an EDTA tube, and RBCs were separated from plasma by centrifugation. The RBC fraction was frozen at −80°C immediately after collection. RBC FA composition was determined as described previously.17 Briefly, RBCs were incubated at 100°C using boron trifluoride methanol and hexane to generate FA methyl esters that were then analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. N-3 FAs analyzed included α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n3), EPA (20:5n3), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 22:5n3), DHA (22:6n3), and the Omega-3 Index (EPA + DHA).3 The coefficients of variation for these were 10.7%, 7.8%, 3.8%, 3.3%, and 2.4%, respectively. Sample characteristics were summarized using standard statistical metrics (eg, means, standard deviations (SDs), and correlations). Hazard ratios were estimated using the survival package in R.18 Primary analyses related incident clinical outcomes by date of event (or censoring) to quintiles of the Omega-3 Index, with follow-up analyses adjusting for demographic and medical history covariates. Secondary analyses explored relationships of outcomes by quintiles of individual n-3 PUFA levels, of a modified Omega-3 Index that included DPA, and by risk category of the Omega-3 Index (high risk, ≤4%; intermediate risk, >4% to <8%; and low risk, ≥8%).19 In other analyses, we included the n-6 FAs as covariates and also compared the n-6:n-3 ratio with the Omega-3 Index. Finally, baseline total cholesterol levels were compared with the Omega-3 Index in the same models to get a sense of how this emerging risk factor compared with an established one. All analyses used 2-sided tests at the P < .05 statistical significance level. This analysis was performed on 2500 Framingham Offspring study participants who were free of CVD at baseline and for whom FAs, clinical outcomes, and demographic covariates were available. Follow-up ended on December 31, 2016 (maximum, 11.2 years; median, 7.3 years). Table 1 provides the baseline characteristics of the cohort by mortality status. The average age was 66 years, and there were more women (57%) than men (43%). There were 350 deaths during the follow-up period: 58 were attributable to CVD (17%), 146 to cancer (42%), 128 to other known causes (37%), and 18 from unknown causes (5%). Overall, there were 245 incident cases of CVD, 119 of CHD, and 105 ischemic strokes. (Case and control numbers and length of follow-up for each outcome are in Table S1). We estimated the associations between adjusted risk for fatal outcomes across quintiles of the Omega-3 Index (Fig. 1, with details in Table S2). In the multivariable-adjusted model, death from any cause was significantly and inversely associated with the Omega-3 Index (P for trend = .02). When comparing individuals in the lowest quintile of the Omega-3 Index (<4.2%) to those in the highest (>6.8%), risk was 34% lower. Median values for the extreme quintiles were 3.7% and 7.8%. The modified Omega-3 Index (which included DPA) performed no differently from the original metric (Table S3), and an examination of the relations between risk and the three Omega-3 Index risk categories found a significant trend across the categories (P = .04), but only the intermediate category differed significantly from the high-risk category (possibly because there were 10-fold more subjects in the intermediate than the highest categories; Table S4). When we controlled for RBC n-6 PUFA levels in the original analysis, or substituted the n-6:n-3 ratio for the Omega-3 Index, there was no material improvement in mortality hazard ratios (Table S5). In neither case did the n-6 PUFAs alter the n-3 PUFA associations. Regarding cause-specific mortality, the Omega-3 Index was only significantly associated with risk for death from “other” (non-CVD, non-cancer) causes (P for trend = .009), with the participants in the first (reference) quintile being at significantly higher risk than those in quintiles 2–5. There was a trend for reduced risk for CVD across Omega-3 Index levels (eg, there was a 61% lower risk between extreme quintiles), but with wide confidence intervals, the differences were nonsignificant. The results for total and cause-specific mortality were similar in analyses including all 2899 participants (ie, including those with a history of CVD; Table S6). The Omega-3 Index was significantly and inversely associated with total CVD, total CHD, and total stroke after adjusting for covariates in a linear trend analysis across quintiles (Table 2; P values for trends = .008, .03, and .006, respectively). Unadjusted hazard ratios are shown in Table S7. The hazard ratio for total CVD was significantly reduced in quintile 5 vs 1, but for total CHD or total stroke, no individual quintile differed significantly from the reference. Similar findings were observed in the full cohort (n = 2899) for total CHD and total stroke, but the relationship with total CVD was no longer statistically significant (Table S8). Using the modified Omega-3 Index (with DPA) did not change the pattern of results (Table S3), and when Omega-3 risk categories were tested, the general pattern of relationships remained the same, but they were mostly nonsignificant (Table S4). Finally, neither including n-6 PUFAs as covariates nor replacing the Omega-3 Index with the n-6:n-3 ratio altered the original results (Table S5). The adjusted risk for experiencing the endpoints of interest by each of the four n-3 PUFAs separately is shown in Table 3 (unadjusted hazard ratios in Table S9). The plant-derived n-3 PUFA, ALA, was not significantly associated with reduced risk for any of the outcomes tested (Table 3). In general, as the levels of the EPA and (especially) DHA increased, risk for disease outcomes and total (and other) mortality decreased (Table 3). The only outcome that DPA was (marginally, P = .059) associated with was death from other causes (Table 3). In the head-to-head comparison of the Omega-3 Index and total cholesterol for total and CVD mortality and for the 3 CVD outcomes, the former metric was significantly associated with risk for 4 of the 5 outcomes, whereas the total cholesterol level, in the same models, was not associated with risk for any of these outcomes (Table 4). In this study of participants in the Framingham Offspring study, the baseline Omega-3 Index at about 66 years of age was inversely associated with total mortality over the next 7 years—with values of the Omega-3 Index significantly lower in those who died during follow-up than those who did not. The same was generally true for the 2 components of the Index, EPA and DHA, but not for RBC DPA n-3 or ALA. Findings for the Omega-3 Index persisted in a model adjusted for 18 other relevant variables including plasma lipids and C-reactive protein. We recently reported similar findings to these in the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study where there was a significant inverse trend across quartiles of the Omega-3 Index for total mortality, with the highest quartile being at 22% lower risk for death compared with the lowest.20 That study followed a nationwide sample of 6500, approximately 70-year-old women for 15 years. Kleber et al. also found a 9% decrease in risk for all-cause mortality per 1 SD increase in the Omega-3 Index after 10 years of follow-up in 3259 German CHD patients.21 In the present study, we followed up 2500 men and women for half as long and found an interquintile risk reduction of 34%. We also found reduced risk for total CVD events, CHD events, and stroke. The approximately 50% lower risk for CVD mortality was, however, not statistically significant, most likely due to having only 58 events in the analysis (see below). Nevertheless, these findings are generally consistent with those of several meta-analyses that all linked higher n-3 PUFA biomarker levels with reduced risk for “coronary events”22 or fatal CHD.19,23 This study was somewhat unique, however, in exploring relations between RBC n-3 PUFA levels instead of whole plasma or plasma phospholipid n-3 PUFAs. But since these markers of n-3 PUFA status are strongly intercorrelated,24 this coherence is expected. The causes of death most strongly associated with the Omega-3 Index were non-CVD and non-cancer, ie, “other” causes. By design, the FHS focused primarily on CVD outcomes, so details of the other causes of death are unavailable. An 11% reduction (per 1 SD increase in the Omega-3 Index) in risk for death from other causes was also seen in the women's study mentioned previously.20 It is unclear what mechanism might explain this observation; but since n-3 PUFAs are known to have a wide variety of effects on cell membrane biology,25,26 a systemic impact of higher levels of these FAs on overall cellular health is possible. As noted earlier, several recent randomized trials of fish oil with total mortality as an endpoint have been null, but they typically showed trends toward a benefit.27,28 More consistent with our observations was a 2017 meta-analysis,29 which found a significant 19% reduction in risk for coronary death associated with fish oil treatment. Two nonrandomized retrospective studies using governmental databases to track patient outcomes (one from England30 and another from Italy31) reported lower risk for all-cause mortality in those CHD patients who had been prescribed 1 g of fish oil at discharge. Finally, higher plasma long-chain n-3 FA levels were strongly associated with reduced risk for total mortality and CHD outcomes in renal transplant patients in Norway.32 A somewhat surprising observation in this study was the low rate of CVD in this population, with only 17% of deaths being attributable to CVD (as opposed to 42% from cancer). Part of this is clearly the exclusion from the analysis set of participants with CVD at baseline, but even including these individuals, the CVD death rate was only 22%. This relatively low CVD death rate should perhaps not be surprising given the reduction in heart disease mortality in the United States over the last several decades. For example, the age-standardized death rate from heart disease per 100,000 people dropped from 520 in 1969 to 167 in 2014, a 68% decline.33 With regard to the individual RBC n-3 PUFAs studied here, in the multivariable-adjusted model, ALA was not significantly related to any measured outcome in the quintile analysis. The null mortality findings for ALA agree with some previous studies,34,35 but higher circulating ALA levels (primarily plasma and plasma phospholipids) have been favorably associated with CVD death,23 and ALA intake was associated with reduced total mortality in a large randomized clinical trial (RCT) from Spain.36 So, evidence for ALA remains mixed. Turning to DPA, in the final model, it was not related with any examined outcome (although trends were favorable). This contrasts with a previous meta-analysis in which this FA (again, more often measured in whole plasma or plasma phospholipids) was inversely associated with risk for CVD death.23 In light of this and other prior reports (eg, in heart failure37), the utility of RBC DPA as a risk marker remains unclear. Nevertheless, because of the growing evidence for a beneficial role of DPA,38 it is reasonable to ask why this FA is not a component of the Omega-3 Index. Including it would be reasonable if adding it to EPA and DHA improved the utility of the metric in risk assessment. In the present study, we compared the original and the modified Omega-3 Index (Table S3) and found essentially the same associations with outcomes for both. This would be expected since the correlation between these 2 predictor variables is 0.98. Hence, our findings provide no compelling reason to alter the original definition/components of the Omega-3 Index. We found that the risk of stroke was inversely associated with the Omega-3 Index, but not in a linear manner, ie, hazard ratios were reduced only in the upper 2 quintiles; however, the trend across quintiles was significant. Risk reduction was largely associated with DHA, where risk was 59% lower in the fifth (vs the first) quintile (P < .05). An association between serum long-chain n-3 PUFA levels and stroke risk has been reported previously in cross-sectional studies.39,40 The impact of marine n-3 PUFA levels on ischemic stroke may extend beyond the risk of incident event. Lower plasma proportions of EPA and DHA have been shown to be independently associated with increased ischemic stroke severity and, for DHA, poor functional outcomes at 90 days after stroke.41 In addition, a higher ratio of EPA or DHA to arachidonic acid in serum was associated with lower likelihood of early neurologic deterioration after ischemic stroke.42 A 2012 meta-analysis of 32 observational cohorts and 13 n-3 RCTs reported inverse associations with stroke and fish intake, but no significant relations with either circulating biomarkers or with supplementation,43 although a 2017 study of plasma phospholipid omega-3 FA and incident stroke from 3 cohorts found inverse relations with DHA as we did here.44 A randomized, open-label study in patients surviving myocardial infarction45 showed a reduction in risk of nonfatal stroke with n-3 FA supplementation, and an open-label study in Japan demonstrated no effect on primary prevention of stroke but a 20% relative reduction in recurrent total stroke with EPA supplementation.46 However, some studies have found no relations between n-3 PUFA levels and stroke,47,48 so the n-3 PUFA and stroke literature is mixed, and more studies are needed. A variety of exploratory analyses were conducted here. Given the controversies regarding the CVD effects of the n-6 PUFAs and the frequent use of the n-6:n-3 ratio, in one analysis we controlled for RBC n-6 PUFA levels and in another we directly compared the ratio with the Omega-3 Index. In neither case did the n-6 PUFAs add or detract from the omega-3 effect. Hence, this study found no support for using a combined metric with n-6 and n-3 PUFAs. Finally, we compared associations with disease outcomes for the Omega-3 Index with that of total cholesterol, one of the most well-known CVD risk factors. This analysis was undertaken to give some perspective of the relative sensitivity of these 2 biomarkers. In head-to-head comparisons with the same multivariable models, a higher Omega-3 Index was significantly associated with reduced risk for 4 of the 5 outcomes studies, but cholesterol was unrelated to risk for any outcome. This may be because about 38% of participants were on a cholesterol-lowering medication, and so cholesterol levels at baseline were therapeutically reduced; because 399 subjects with a diagnosis of CVD at baseline were excluded; or because those who were particularly susceptible to cholesterol-induced CHD may have already died. There is indeed some controversy regarding the predictive power of serum cholesterol in older individuals.49 Nevertheless, in the unique context of this study in which we controlled for 17 other variables, cholesterol levels were unassociated with these outcomes. Whatever the reasons, this observation supports the need for further research to more clearly define the relative roles of traditional and emerging biomarkers in risk stratification. The originally proposed (in 2004) clinical cut-points for the Omega-3 Index were <4% (high risk) and >8% (low risk).3 Although these have recently been confirmed in a meta-analysis including 10 cohorts and over 27,000 subjects,19 it was of interest to explore their utility in the present study as well. We found a significant trend across risk categories for total mortality and significant reductions in risk for the intermediate group compared with the high group, but not for the >8% category. This may reflect a nonlinear relationship between the Omega-3 Index and risk as has been suggested by others,25 or the fact that only 10% of the sample was in the >8% category. Nevertheless, the hazard ratio of 0.69 for any death in the >8% category is at least suggestive of lower risk. As alluded to earlier, mechanisms that may explain the associations between higher RBC n-3 PUFA and improved longevity and reduced CVD risk are not clearly understood, but there are beneficial effects of these FAs on a variety of CV risk factors. These include reductions in serum triglyceride levels,50 blood pressure,51 platelet aggregation,52 heart rate,53 susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation (in some settings),54 inflammatory markers,55,56 and plaque vulnerability57,58 along with improvements in endothelial function.59 The observation that blood EPA + DHA levels are independently associated with slower rates of telomere shortening,5 a purported marker of “cellular aging,” is yet another favorable biomarker relationship, but it is not a molecular mechanism. From an observational study, we cannot conclude that raising the Omega-3 Index will have heart benefits and/or prolong life. Nevertheless, it is instructive to consider how much more EPA + DHA an individual might need to consume to move the median Omega-3 Index in quintile 1 (3.7%) to that in quintile 5 (7.8%). Based on a recent dose-response study,60 one can estimate that it would take about 1300 more mg of EPA + DHA per day to do this. This amount of EPA + DHA could be obtained from a single serving (100 g) of farmed salmon61 daily. Alternatively, 4 standard fish oil pills per day would suffice. Several early omega-3 RCTs used 800–1000 mg/d and reported reduced total mortality,6,7,62 whereas other more recent studies at the same dose have not.9,11,63 Several possible reasons for this discrepancy have been proposed.64,65 The strengths of our investigation include the relatively large sample size from a well-characterized community, the unambiguous nature of the primary endpoint, and the use of an objective and standardized biomarker of PUFA exposure that has low biological variability.66 Weaknesses include the assessment of PUFA exposure at only one point in time (which cannot capture changes in PUFA status that may have occurred during follow-up) and the largely Caucasian cohort (which precludes firm conclusions regarding other races). Also, the relatively low event rates, especially for CVD death, limited our ability to detect associations with this endpoint. Although clearly affected by omega-3 PUFA intake, other factors can influence the Omega-3 Index such as smoking and body weight,67 both of which were controlled for here. What we did not (and could not) control for is heritability, which we showed previously to explain about 24% of the variability in this biomarker.67 In the same vein, we did not include in our models the intake of key nutrients (kilocalories, saturated FAs, salt, fiber, etc.), which might contribute to the relationships reported here. However, by controlling for some of the physiological/metabolic consequences of consuming diets of poor quality (body weight, blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, and CRP levels), as well as for socioeconomic variables (which themselves track with poor diets), it is unlikely that including individual nutrients would have altered the outcome of the study. As always, the presence of residual or unmeasured confounding also precludes inferences about causality. For example, despite controlling for multiple lifestyle/health factors, higher omega-3 PUFA levels may simply be a marker for a healthier overall diet and behaviors, which themselves, independent of the omega-3 levels, may be cardioprotective. In conclusion, we observed that higher RBC levels of n-3 PUFAs were associated with greater longevity and reduced risk for several CVD-related endpoints in this community-based sample. These findings, in the context of the totality of available evidence on this topic, provide further support for a role for the use of the Omega-3 Index in risk stratification algorithms.'\n","\n","'>>> Title: Virtual metrology frame technique for improving dynamic performance of a small size machine tool'\n","'>>> abstract: This paper presents a novel concept, a virtual metrology frame, for enhancing the dynamic performance of a machine tool with a flexible structural frame. The dynamic properties of a machine are directly affected by the stiffness of its frame, and its reference system; thus, by having an unstressed metrology frame, superior dynamic capabilities can be achieved. The developed concept does not require physical components associated with metrology frame; hence it is ideal for machine tools with requirements for small footprint and ultra-precision performance. The concept relies on an accelerometer based dynamic displacement feedback technique, where the accelerometer is used as a precision frame displacement sensor. The concept does not require a complex controller, and was realized in an off-the-shelf CNC controller. The concept was demonstrated on a linear motion system, a simplified version of a compact size CNC machine, and its servo bandwidth and dynamic stiffness were improved by 36% and 70% respectively, which are the key parameters for improving the machining accuracy.'\n","'>>> body_text: Reduction of machining error enables higher dimension accuracy in Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) machines. The significant fraction (90%) of machining error is cause by dynamic positioning error in a machine tool servo [1]; this positioning error results in a contour error on the machined part. In Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) type servo controllers, the most common controller used in industrial CNCs [2], tracking error contributes to error in position; tracking error occurs in a closed-loop control system due to an inability to follow rapidly varying position commands [3]. This error can be reduced by increasing feedback gains and servo bandwidth [4–7]; however, the amounts by which these parameters can be increased are limited by sensitivity to measurement noise and mechanical resonance excitation, respectively [4,7,8]. There are three important types of mechanical resonances that can limit machine dynamics [9]: actuator flexibility, guiding system flexibility, and frame flexibility. Actuator flexibility occurs when there is compliance between the motor and the load, typically where there is a gear in the system. Guiding system flexibility occurs when the driving force is not coincident with the center of gravity and stiffness is limited. Frame flexibility occurs due to servo-reaction forces causing dynamic deformation, resulting in frame resonance excitation i.e. a stressed frame. The problem of servo control limited by mechanical resonance in machine tools is well studied in literature, most references focus on actuator flexibility; few papers describe the problem of flexible frames [10–13]. Notch filtering is commonly used in industry to attenuate mechanical resonances in the control signal [14]; however this reduces the drives’ bandwidths, limiting its application in improving machine tool performance [15]. Pre-filtering trajectory techniques can be used to reduce machine structure excitation [16], however their implementation is challenging [8]. Impulse/jerk decoupling technology [17,18] utilizes a mechanical low-pass filter, which adds another degree of freedom to the system. An expansion to this technology, which is often used in the lithographic industry, is a dual stage motion system [19,20]. In this concept a fine short stroke motor with ultraprecision positioning is mounted to a coarse driving mechanism; however, this concept is complex and requires additional sensors, actuators, volume, and cost. Acceleration feedback was used for damping structural resonances [16,21,22]; by adding acceleration feedback to the position control loop, as an inner feedback loop, the disturbance force experiences a virtually larger mass, improving the process sensitivity [23]. Process dynamics, controller calculation delay, and accelerometer roll-off result in instability. Reducing the acceleration loop gain for higher frequencies counteract this instability; however to maintain position loop stability margins the acceleration loop requires a high bandwidth [21,24]. Controllers in industrial feed drives commonly use position feedback only, since other movement variables are not available [16,21], this limits acceleration feedback realization in commercial CNC. Acceleration can be measured directly by an accelerometer, calculated from the second derivative of position measurements, or by observer techniques. Using accelerometer provides absolute acceleration measurement; however, both rigid body and structural vibrations are mixed in the signal. Differentiation of position signal produces quantization noise [25], passing this signal through filters limits the closed loop control performance [26]. Acceleration observers offers lower noise content than differentiation, however these are limited by parameter dependence [26,27]. The position signal in a linear motion system is typically provided by a linear encoder which is generally located at the machine frame; hence, deformation in flexible elements anywhere between the encoder scale and the point to be controlled is not compensated [28]. In [29] an accelerometer located close to the Tool Center Point (TCP) is used. The TCP position is estimated by a state space observer, and used as position feedback, improving dynamic behavior; however, this implementation is non-trivial due to the non-collocated control [22]. In [8] a model-based control is used to estimate the machine frame deformation with respect to the TCP, where no additional drive is required; however, frequency and damping of structural modes may vary over time, and also as a function of machine configuration [16]. This paper addresses the problem of frame flexibility, which is often neglected in the design stage, thus leading to unexpected problems during the prototype test phase [10]. A virtual metrology frame technique was developed to achieve high dynamic performance as though the machine has a separate stiff metrology frame, by measuring machine frame displacement using an acceleration sensor. The developed technique was implemented on a commercial PID controller, while other structural resonance compensation techniques cannot be applied in commercial CNC systems [30]. The Virtual Metrology Frame (VMF) concept was designed to improve the performance of a machine with flexible frame phenomena that limit performance. The dynamic properties of the machine are directly affected by the stiffness of the frame and its reference system. By utilizing an unstressed metrology frame, superior dynamic capabilities can be achieved [10,19,31,32]. The VMF concept is realized (Fig. 1a) by distinguishing between the carriage position, with respect to the stressed frame Xc, and the frame displacement due to flexible modes Xf; hence, an unperturbed position signal Xvmf can be obtained in the presence of these frame flexible modes. A typical PID controller structure C can be applied using the VMF (Fig. 1b). A reference position signal Xset is fed into the controller C, with output u, the control signal. The plant P is the system to be controlled, it has input u, and output Xc measured by a position sensor, typically a linear encoder; however, in the VMF concept a second output to the plant Xf, the frame displacement, is added to Xc within the controller; thus, the controlled position signal Xvmf is the sum of the position measurement signals, enabling attenuation of the machine frame resonance. The VMF concept does not require physical components associated with a metrology frame, hence it is ideal for a compact size machine tool with the requirement for small footprint [33,34] and ultra-precision performance [35,36]. Furthermore, this concept is very suitable for industrial deployment as it allows implementation within an off-the-shelf controller without modification. The concept was simply implemented in a PID controller, which is the most common controller found in industrial machine tools [2,5,37]. The VMF concept relies on real-time measurement of the frame displacement – “frame displacement sensor” (Fig. 1b). Common techniques for precision displacement sensors require a fixed reference system [38,39], i.e. a secondary physical frame. A unique frame displacement measurement technique using accelerometers was developed [40], which offers a superior solution without a secondary physical frame. The accelerometer measures the acceleration of a point without a fixed reference system; thus, by double integration the frame displacement Xf can be estimated relative to its “unstressed state” (Fig. 1a). The VMF concept uses an accelerometer to measure frame displacement, thus it differs from acceleration feedback techniques as no special inner loop, i.e. acceleration feedback, is required; hence no special technique is required to tune the controller gains. Furthermore, the technique offers wideband frame resonances attenuation, and there is no “targeted” resonance to attenuate as in other common techniques [14]. The controller update rate is significantly lower than the encoder and frame displacement sensor update rates, thus the position feedback register (in the controller) is simply their sum according to (3); and no special sensors fusion technique is required. Real-time implementation of acceleration based displacement measurement in a control system has two main conflicting requirements: small phase error JP and low displacement noise Jσ; thus, it is rarely reported [44], especially for long term (>10 s) and accurate (<0.1 μm) measurements [45]. The estimator was constrained to measure only dynamic displacement of the machine frame that occurs at flexible resonances frequencies (>ωc); hence it optimize: the displacement noise Jσ, phase error JP, and magnitude error JM resulting from double integration of, and HPF application to, the acceleration signal [40]. The μ4 is a small size CNC machine with 6 axes which was conceived in 2008 by Cranfield University [36]. In order to reduce the machine footprint and ease manufacturing, the design was based on modules with common design and simple interfaces; thus, the machine motion axes were split into two near identical modules. Each module consists of at least one rotary, and one linear motions made by direct drive motors (Fig. 4). A simplified linear motion module [46], which represents one of the machine motion modules, consisting of: frame, air-bearings, linear motor, linear encoder, and carriage, was used for this study (Fig. 5). The driving force and the position sensor were not applied at the center of gravity but on the “master side”, thus, the carriage movement is dependent on the high stiffness of the air-bearings, which suppresses motion in an undesired direction. The carriage and the frame mass are mc = 17 kg and mf = 24 kg respectively. A software-based machine controller (Aerotech A3200) was used to control the motion system with a linear digital amplifier (Aerotech Ndrive ML). The digital servo amplifier has a current loop update rate of 50 μs, servo loop update rate of 125 μs, and a tunable PID digital control loop. The frame displacement sensor was connected to the auxiliary analogue input of the drive amplifier. Its update rate was equivalent to the servo update rate. Summation of the encoder and frame displacement signals was implemented in the controller (Fig. 1b). A linear encoder (Renishaw RELM 20U) with 20 μm pitch was used as the position feedback sensor. Using a controller multiplication factor of 65536, the position resolution was 0.30 nm, and sub divisional error was nominally <±30 nm [47]. System identification techniques [48,49] showed flexible frame characteristics, where a relative movement between the frame and the carriage is measured by the encoder (Fig. 6). These appear as resonances in the plant Frequency Response Function (FRF) as the encoder scale is mounted to the machine frame, while its read-head is mounted to the carriage (Fig. 5). To maintain co-located control, the accelerometer was fixed to the frame as close as possible to the encoder scale (Fig. 7), and aligned with respect to the encoder. The accelerometer location was chosen based on the machine modal analysis [48,49]. The frame displacement sensor was realized using a combination of: an accelerometer, signal conditioner, and an xPC target machine (Fig. 8). A triaxial ceramic shear Integrated Electronic Piezoelectric (IEPE) general purpose accelerometer (PCB 356A025) was used to determine the frame displacement. The accelerometer sensitivity was 25 mV/g. IEPE accelerometers are the appropriate sensor for low amplitude vibration measurements due to their: low noise; wide dynamic, frequency, and temperature range; high sensitivity; and availability in small sizes [50]. A low noise signal conditioner was used to power the IEPE accelerometer, and to decouple the acceleration signal (PCB 482C15). The signal conditioner has a typical phase distortion of ±1°. The xPC target machine (Speedgoat performance) was used for Digital Signal Processing (DSP) with an update rate of 18 μs. It contains 16 bit Analogue Digital Converter (ADC) and Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC). The conversion time for the ADC and DAC is 5 μs and 3 μs, respectively. The xPC target machine is optimized for MathWorks® SIMULINK® and xPC Target™. The frame displacement sensor delay, based on an optimized displacement estimator, is shown in Fig. 9. The frame displacement sensor was validated against a laser interferometer (Renishaw ML10 gold standard) [40] and capacitance sensors (Lion precision PX405HC) [42,43]. Displacement noise was σ < 30 nm over 10 min of measurement [40]. This section shows the experimental results validating the VMF concept, and comparison of the optimized controller with and without the VMF concept. The VMF concept was realized by connecting the xPC target machine output Xf to the machine controller. Summation of the two signals in the controller was set to the maximum update rate – the servo update rate of 125 μs. Using sinusoidal excitation the machine plant Transfer Function (TF) was measured. Comparison of the plant TFs with and without the VMF is shown in Fig. 10. A significant magnitude reduction of 12 dB in the frame’s first resonance can be observed. Furthermore, the VMF has been shown to be a wide bandwidth resonance attenuation technique. The second resonance shows no attenuation by this setup as its mode shape produced a non-collinear displacement to the measured axis; this second resonance causes a relative movement between the encoder read-head and scale which is measured as displacement and appears as a resonance, while the frame displacement sensor measures only collinear displacement to the measured axis. A PID controller (Section 4) was designed and optimized based on curve fitted plant TFs with and without the VMF (Fig. 9); a ‘peak picking’ curve fitting method [55] was used to curve fit the measured plant TFs. A Bi-quad filter (9) was used to attenuate the machine second resonance, with the following parameters: ζn = 0.0175, ζd = 0.2156, and fn = fd = 198 Hz. The optimization results of the PID filter gains are shown in Table 1. To aid in the comparison between the two optimized controllers, a vector margin stability criteria Ms was used [56]. Because the vector margin is a single margin parameter, it removes all the ambiguities in assessing stability using gain and phase margins. Implementing the VMF in the control system improved the proportional and derivative gains by 70% and 38% respectively, while the overshoot was reduced, and the stability margin remains almost the same (Fig. 11), thus, the open loop crossover frequency, i.e. servo bandwidth, was improved by 36%. The open loop Nyquist and Bode plots with and without the VMF concept are shown in Figs. 11 and 12. Three sensitivity functions determine the feedback error of the system: sensitivity function S(s), complementary sensitivity function T(s), and process sensitivity function PS(s) [57]: these functions represent the ability of the feedback system to reject disturbances acting on the output of the system; the system response to the reference in case Xset = 1; and the machine dynamic compliance respectively. The sensitivity functions with and without the VMF are shown in Fig. 13. When the VMF was applied, the machine dynamic stiffness (inverse process sensitivity) and sensitivity function were shown to be equivalent to the improved proportional gain. The Virtual Metrology Frame is a servo plant compensation technique to address frame flexibility. It offers a solution of enhancing machine performance utilizing a virtual metrology system, without a physical metrology frame. The developed concept is insensitive to plant frequency changes in contrast with common techniques. The VMF concept is based on a technique to measure frame displacement without having a fixed reference system. Using bespoke signal processing, an accelerometer was used as a precision positioning (displacement) sensor. Implementing the VMF concept on the linear motion system, the metrology loop showed superior rigidity; this was due to the virtual separation of the metrology system and the force system. The VMF was designed to measure encoder scale displacement that occurs due to frame flexible modes only; whilst floor vibrations and rigid body modes, which appear in the acceleration signal, are attenuated significantly by the HPF. The VMF concept could be implemented in a multi-axes system, such as CNC machine, for each motion axis independently; hence measuring the position of the carriage (or the tool) relative to the “unstressed state” of the reference frame. The effectiveness of the VMF concept in a multi-axes machine should be addressed in a future study. Furthermore, this technique could also be implemented in rotary axes by using angular accelerometers. The concept can be implemented in any feedback controller, requiring only a summing of two position signals: encoder and frame displacement; thus it very suitable for industrial deployment. It can be used to improve the performance of an existing machine with minimal retro-fit to the machine. In the future, the Speedgoat controller could be replaced seamlessly by dedicated lower cost electronics, such as a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and would be connected to the auxiliary analogue input in the controller. The concept was demonstrated on a simplified motion module of a commercial CNC machine equipped with a PID controller. The flexible frame resonances present in the position signal were attenuated significantly, but not completely. This can be explained by the fact that frame vibrations cause forced vibrations of the carriage; however, a significant improvement to the servo bandwidth and dynamic stiffness were shown, which are key parameters for improving the machining accuracy. These improvements were implemented with no affect upon the system stability.'\n","\n","'>>> Title: Preformulation Characterization and Stability Assessments of Secretory IgA Monoclonal Antibodies as Potential Candidates for Passive Immunization by Oral Administration'\n","'>>> abstract: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a major cause of diarrheal disease among children in developing countries, and there are no licensed vaccines to protect against ETEC. Passive immunization by oral delivery of ETEC-specific secretory IgAs (sIgAs) could potentially provide an alternative approach for protection in targeted populations. In this study, a series of physiochemical techniques and an in vitro gastric digestion model were used to characterize and compare key structural attributes and stability profiles of 3 anti–heat-labile enterotoxin mAbs (sIgA1, sIgA2, and IgG1 produced in CHO cells). The mAbs were evaluated in terms of primary structure, N-linked glycan profiles, size and aggregate content, relative apparent solubility, conformational stability, and in vitro antigen binding. Compared to IgG1 mAb, sIgA1 and sIgA2 mAbs showed increased sample heterogeneity, especially in terms of N-glycan composition and the presence of higher molecular weight species. The sIgA mAbs showed overall better physical stability and were more resistant to loss of antigen binding activity during incubation at low pH, 37°C with pepsin. These results are discussed in terms of future challenges to design stable, low-cost formulations of sIgA mAbs as an oral supplement for passive immunization to protect against enteric diseases in the developing world.'\n","'>>> body_text: Diarrheal diseases are the second leading cause of death in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia,1-3 with ∼0.6 million children under 5 years of age dying each year due to complications caused by severe diarrhea.4,5 A major cause of diarrhea is from drinking water contaminated by pathogenic bacteria, viruses, or parasites.4 Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the most common bacterial cause of diarrhea-associated mortality, which leads to approximately one quarter of all diarrheal episodes for infants and children less than 5 years of age.6-9 To further complicate these problems, enhanced antibiotic resistance has been found in many ETEC strains.10-12 Thus, the development of an ETEC vaccine is considered the most effective and feasible strategy to prevent diarrheal diseases among children in developing countries13,14 and has become a high priority for the World Health Organization.15 Currently, however, there are no ETEC vaccines commercially available and there are numerous scientific challenges (e.g., heterogeneity of potential target antigens,4 poor mucosal immunogenicity responses, and potential safety issues of with antigens) as well as cost hurdles (e.g., develop, manufacture, and commercialize for use in the developing world) that impede ETEC vaccine development.7,13 Owing to these challenges, there is growing interest in the use of passive immunization strategies to treat ETEC-induced diarrheal diseases in targeted populations by oral delivery of neutralizing immunoglobulins. For example, local delivery of antibodies that bind and neutralize ETEC in the GI tract could be used to prevent infection. Multiple virulence factors from ETEC have been recognized as potential antigens for passive immunity,10,16 including secretion heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) that directly induces diarrhea by prompting solute retention and loss of water absorption in the intestinal lumen. LT is a heterohexameric A-B subunit toxin comprised of a catalytically active A-subunit and 5 B subunits.16 Subunit A has ADP-ribosylation activity, which covalently modifies the subunit of the GTP-binding protein (Gs), leading to the constitutive activation of adenylate cyclase and production of 3′,5′-cyclic AMP (cAMP).17 Consequently, continuous release of chloride and water into the intestinal lumen occurs causing watery diarrhea. The 5 B subunits mediate LT binding to glycolipid and glycoprotein receptors on host cells.17 Thus, antibody-induced neutralization of LT enzymatic activity and inhibition of adhesion could potentially be effective in controlling ETEC infection. Secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies are of particular interest for passive immunization during oral administration due to their natural abundance in secretions and mucosal surfaces.18 As the most prevalent immunoglobulin isotype in mucosal membranes, secretory IgAs (sIgAs) play crucial roles in protecting gut mucosal surfaces from pathogens and toxins.19-21 Secretory IgAs function to promote clearance of pathogens, maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, direct neutralization of bacterial virulence factors (e.g., enterotoxins), and modulation of proinflammatory responses.19-22 Therefore, sIgA mAbs are a potential therapeutic platform for passive immunization by oral administration.23 Secretory IgA antibodies consist of dimeric IgG-like molecules, linked by a joining chain (J-chain), and complexed with a secretory component (SC) chain.24 The SC protein is acquired as the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor cleaves upon transport across epithelial cells into mucosal surfaces and secretions. Secretory IgA antibodies are inherently more resistant to proteolysis by digestive enzymes when compared to IgG in the gastrointestinal tract.25,26 In this work, 3 anti-LT isotype variants (sIgA1, sIgA2, and IgG1) were expressed and purified from CHO cells in quantities of ∼5-10 mg. A series of physiochemical methods were developed (to accommodate limited availability of material) and used for preformulation characterization of anti-LT sIgA1, sIgA2, and IgG1 mAbs including evaluating various structural attributes (i.e., primary structure, post-translational modifications, size heterogeneity and aggregation, conformational stability, relative solubility, and antibody binding), and downselecting the key structural attributes of the sIgA mAbs to monitor during stability assessments. To this end, we examined the stability profile of the 3 anti-LT mAbs under conditions that mimic the gastric phase of oral delivery using simulated gastric fluids in a modified, scaled-down version of an in vitro gastric digestive model. These results are evaluated in terms of relative rank-ordering of the pharmaceutical stability of the 3 anti-LT mAbs from the point of view of future formulation development work to optimize both storage stability as well as stability during oral delivery. The 3 anti–heat-labile toxin (LT) immunoglobulins (sIgA1, sIgA2, and IgG1) were expressed in CHO cells and purified by MassBiologics (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Boston, MA). The antibodies were prepared in 10 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2 (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) and stored at 2°C-8°C. Protein concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using known concentrations of sIgA1, sIgA2, or IgG1 as standards. When the protein concentration was determined by UV-visible spectroscopy, extinction coefficients were calculated based on the primary sequences27 as 1.49, 1.49, 1.64 mL mg−1 cm−1 for sIgA1, sIgA2, and IgG1, respectively. To determine the stability of the proteins under simulated gastric conditions, each Ig was diluted in SGF, which was composed of 94 mM NaCl, 13 mM KCl, 0.15 mM CaCl2, along with 10 mM citrate-phosphate buffer pH 3.5 (added to maintain pH). Protein samples were either diluted directly into SGF-CP buffer alone or SGF-CP buffer with added bicarbonate buffer (9:1 ratio of the digestion solution and a bicarbonate neutralization buffer containing 0.03 M trisodium citrate and 0.3 M sodium bicarbonate at pH 8.533) at a final protein concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. The reaction was started when the pepsin (2000 U/mL pepsin, Sigma)29 was added to the solution and samples were incubated at 37°C for varying amounts of time. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 400 mM NaOH to adjust to neutral pH. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and ELISA. For ELISA analysis, samples were diluted in ELISA blocking buffer (0.1% BSA in PBS) at 40 μg/mL and 1 μg/mL of sIgAs and IgG1 digested samples based on the starting concentration, respectively, and stored at −20°C until analysis. The Ig samples were diluted in SGF-CP buffer (see composition mentioned previously) at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. Immobilized pepsin-agarose (ThermoFisher) was washed 3 times in SGF by centrifugation at 12,000× g before addition to the diluted Ig mAb mixture to a final pepsin concentration of 2000 U/mL. Samples were incubated at 37°C with end-over-end rotation to keep the beads in suspension. Beads were removed by centrifugation at 12,000× g for 1 min upon completion of the desired incubation times, and the supernatant was removed. Samples were then neutralized by addition of 400 mM NaOH before analysis by SE-HPLC. SE-HPLC was performed as described previously, but with an injection volume of 25 μL. In this work, 96-well affinity immunoassay plates (Thermal Scientific, Rochester, NY) were coated with 1.0 μg/mL heat-labile enterotoxin, B subunit (LTB) from E. coli (Sigma E8656) in PBS pH 7.2 and incubated overnight at 4°C. The next day, after removing coating solution, 96-well plates were filled with 200 μL of ELISA blocking buffer (0.1% BSA in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. After flicking out blocking buffer, digested Ig samples were loaded 1:1 with blocking buffer and 1:1 serial dilutions were performed using blocking buffer as the diluent. Samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were washed 3 times with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS, then 50 μL/well of HRP-conjugated Goat anti-human Ig protein (Fisher, Southern Biotechnology Associates) diluted in blocking buffer (1:15,000 was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were washed as before, and 100 μL/well TMB substrate solution (3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine [TMB]) was added and incubated for 5 min at room temperature in the dark. The reaction was quenched with 100 μL/well 1 M phosphoric acid. Optical density was recorded using a SpectraMax M5 microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices) at 450 nm. Antibody binding to LTB by ELISA correlates with functional activity of the antibody as measured by GM1 holotoxin assay and Y-1 pathology assay (data not shown). Twenty microliters of each 0.2 mg/mL Ig sample was mixed with or without 1 μL of PNGase F (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) and incubated overnight at 37°C. Both deglycosylated and glycosylated Ig samples were reduced with 50 mM dithiothreitol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 70°C for 30 min. Reduced and nonreduced samples were then mixed with 4X LDS loading dye (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) containing 100 mM iodoacetamide (Life Technologies) and incubated at 100°C for 5 min. Samples were cooled to room temperature and separated by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using NuPAGE 10% Bis-tris gels (Life Technologies) and MOPS running buffer (Life Technologies) at 150 V for 75 min. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 (Teknova, Hollister, CA) and destained with 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid. Gels were digitized using an AlphaImager (Protein Simple, Santa Clara, CA) gel imaging system. A Shimadzu Prominence ultrafast liquid chromatography HPLC system equipped with a diode array detector (with absorbance detection at 214 nm) was used. The system was equilibrated at 0.5 mL/min flow rate in 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 for at least 2 h. Ten μL of each Ig (10 μg total protein) was injected and separated by a TOSOH TSKgel G4000SWXL column (8 μm particle size, 7.8 mm ID × 30 cm) for sIgA or a TOSOH TSK-Gel BioAssist G3SWxl column (5 μm size, 7.8 mm ID × 30 cm) for IgG1 with a corresponding guard column operated at ambient temperature (Tosoh Biosciences) using a 30-min run time. Gel filtration molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) were injected before and after the Ig sample sets to ensure integrity of the column and HPLC system. Potential presence of larger aggregates was determined by running Ig samples with and without the size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column (i.e., protein percentage recovery). Greater than 95% protein recovery was obtained for each of the 3 mAbs by SE-HPLC, indicating minimal loss of protein (e.g., larger aggregates) by using optimized SE-HPLC conditions for sIgA versus IgG1. Data were analyzed using LC-Solution software (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC) was performed using a Proteome Lab XL-I (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a scanning ultraviolet-visible optical system. Samples were diluted to 0.2 mg/mL in PBS pH 7.2 and transferred into Beckman charcoal-epon 2 sector cells with a 12 mm centerpiece and sapphire windows. All experiments were performed at 20°C after at least 1 h of equilibration after the rotor reached 20°C. SV-AUC was performed at a rotor speed of 40,000 RPM and with detection at 280 nm. The data were analyzed using Sedfit software (Dr. Peter Schuck, NIH). The partial specific volume was calculated using Sednterp software (Professor Thomas Laue, University of New Hampshire) based on the primary sequence. The buffer density and viscosity used in the analysis were also calculated using Sednterp based on the composition of the buffer. The density and viscosity of PBS buffer were calculated to be 1.0059 g/mL and 0.01021 Poise, respectively. A continuous c(s) distribution model was applied with a range from 0 to 15 Svedbergs, with a resolution of 300 points per distribution and a confidence level of 0.95. Baseline, radial-independent noise, and time-independent noise were fit parameters, while the meniscus and bottom positions were set manually. Ninety microliters of 0.5 mg/mL Ig samples were reduced with 3 μL of 0.5 M dithiothreitol for 30 min at 80°C and alkylated with 6 μL of 0.5 M iodoacetamide for 30 min at 37°C in the dark. The samples were then incubated overnight at 37°C with 12 μg of trypsin or chymotrypsin (∼1:25 enzyme:Ig ratio). The following day, the samples were heated to 98°C for 5 min to inactivate the enzyme. After cooling, samples were treated with PNGase F (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) as described above to remove N-linked oligosaccharides. Before LC-MS injections, 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid was added, and samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000× g. The peptides from the digested protein solution were then separated by reversed phase UHPLC (Thermo Scientific) using a C18 column (1.7μm, 2.1 × 150 mm, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) and a 85 min 0%-30% B gradient (A: H2O and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; B: ACN and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; 200 μL/min flow rate). MS was performed using an LTQ-XL ion trap (Thermo Scientific) and Xcalibur v2.0 software (Thermo Scientific). The instrument was tuned using a standard calibration peptide (Angiotensin II, Sigma) for maximal sensitivity before running any experiments. The mass spectra were acquired in the LTQ over a mass range of m/z 400-1900 using an ion selection threshold of 40,000 counts and a dynamic exclusion duration of 5 s. Raw experimental files were processed using PepFinder 2.0 software (Thermo Scientific). The database used for this experiment consisted of the primary sequences of all Ig molecules. Potential Cys carbamidomethylation, Asn deamidation, and Met oxidation were included in the analysis. Peptide assignments of tandem MS spectra were validated using a confidence score of >95%. A glycoprotein carbohydrate estimation kit (ThermoFisher #23260) was used to determine the total carbohydrate content (both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides) in Ig samples as a percentage of total protein mass. Before experiments, protein samples were buffer-exchanged into PBS at pH 7.2 using 30 kD MWCO filters (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) and a final concentration of 0.25 mg/mL Ig was used in each reaction. The recommended procedure provided by the manufacturer was used. Absorbance at 550 nm was determined using a SpectraMax M5 microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices). Lysozyme, BSA, ovalbumin, Apo-transferrin, fetuin, and α1-acid were used as glycoprotein standards to construct a standard curve. A GlycoWorks RapiFluor-MS N-Glycan Kit (Waters Corporation) was used to identify and quantify N-linked glycans following the manufacturer instructions. Briefly, Ig samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, 7.5 μL of 2 mg/mL Igs were mixed with 15.3 μL ultrapure water and 6 μL Rapi-surfactant and then heated at 90°C for 3 min. After cooling to ambient temperature, 1.2 μL of Rapi-PNGase F was added and samples were incubated at 50°C for 5 min to release N-linked glycans. Labeling was performed by combining oligosaccharide samples with 12 μL RapiFluor-MS reagent for 5 min. The reaction was diluted in 358 μL of acetonitrile and the reaction products purified using an HILIC μElution plate. The plate was washed 3 times in wash buffer (1% formic acid, 90% acetonitrile) and eluted in 90 μL of elution buffer. The samples were further diluted in 310 μL of diluent buffer. Fluor-MS N-glycan analysis was performed using an Agilent 1260 Infinity II HPLC system equipped with a 1260 FLD detector (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and an Agilent 6230 electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). An HILIC AdvanceBio Glycan Mapping column (120 Å, 2.1 × 150 mm, 2.7 μm), that was operated at 45°C, was used to separate various N-glycans. Fifty microliters of prepared samples were injected into LC-MS system, with a flow rate of 0.6 mg/mL and a gradient run time of 55 min. Fluorescence data were obtained using excitation and emission wavelengths of 265 and 425 nm, respectively. MS was acquired simultaneously from 400 to 2000 m/z at a constant scan rate of one spectrum per second. N-glycans were assigned based on m/z values using a N-glycan database,28 and N-glycan quantification was calculated on integration of the fluorescence chromatogram. Thermal unfolding experiments were performed with Ig samples diluted in either PBS pH 7.2 or buffer exchanged into a modified simulated gastric fluid (SGF) containing 94 mM NaCl, 13 mM KCl with 10 mM citrate phosphate (CP) buffer at pH 3.0.29 Samples were then diluted in the corresponding buffer to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. A fluorescence plate reader equipped with a charge-coupled device detector (Fluorescence Innovations, Minneapolis, MN) was used to obtain intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra. Twenty microliters of each sample were loaded into a 384-well plate (Hard-Shell 384-well PCR plates) and overlaid with 2 μL of silicon oil (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Samples were excited at 295 nm (>95% tryptophan emission) and the emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 450 nm with an integration time of 100 ms. Temperature ramps were programmed from 10°C to 100°C with an increment of 2.5°C per step. The mean center of spectra mass peak algorithm was used to analyze the data to determine the shift in fluorescence peak position as a function of temperature.30 Denaturant unfolding experiments were performed using 8 M stock solution of GdnHCl prepared in either PBS pH 7.2 or SGF containing 10 mM CP buffer at pH 3.0. Ig samples were buffer-exchanged and diluted to a final Ig concentration of 0.2 mg/mL, with a series of GdnHCl concentrations from 0 to 5.5 M. Ten microliters of each Ig sample was transferred to a 384-well plate (Hard-Shell 384-well PCR plates) and incubated at 4°C overnight before performing fluorescence measurements as outlined previously, but without the silicone oil overlay and at a fixed temperature (10°C). Data analysis was performed as described previously.30 Relative solubility of Igs was performed by adapting the method by Gibson et al.31 and Toprani et al.32 using smaller volumes. Briefly, 384-well polystyrene filter plates (Corning Life Sciences, Corning, NY) were used. Thirty percent of w/v PEG10,000 stock solutions were prepared in either PBS pH 7.2 or SGF containing 10 mM CP buffer pH 3.0. Various concentrations of PEG10,000 solutions ranging from 0% to 25% w/v were prepared with Ig concentration of 0.2 mg/mL for both buffer conditions. Samples were incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark. The next day, plates were centrifuged at 1233× g for 15 min and directly eluted into a clean 384-well plate. Relative protein concentration in each well was determined using a SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices) using detection at 214 nm. %PEGmidpt values were then calculated as described previously.31 In this work, we used various analytical tools to perform preformulation characterization of 3 anti-LT mAbs (sIgA1, sIgA2, and IgG1) to identify key structural attributes of the mAbs to then subsequently monitor for various stability assessments and for future formulation development work. As shown schematically in Figure 1a, sIgA antibodies are known to be composed of 2 IgG-like molecules which are disulfide linked by a ∼16 kDa joining chain (termed the J-chain), and also a ∼70 kDa SC chain that is complexed via the heavy chains in the Fc domains.24 The combined molecular weight of sIgA polypeptide chains is ∼380 kDa which increases to ∼435-460 kDa due to 15%-20% N-linked and O-linked glycosylation depending upon the sIgA subclass (see below). In comparison, IgG antibodies are less structurally complex and smaller (∼150 kDa with 1%-2% N-linked glycosylation). The sIgA antibodies shown schematically in Figure 1a are commonly referred to as dimeric sIgA in the literature34 (we use the terms sIgA and dimeric sIgA interchangeably in this work while we refer to the IgG antibody simply as IgG1). There are 2 main subclasses of sIgAs (sIgA1 and sIgA2) which structurally differ primarily in their hinge regions (e.g., length of hinge region, disulfide-bonding pattern, and the type and number of attached glycosylation sites)35 as depicted schematically in Figure 1a. Two and three conserved N-linked glycans are found on each Fc domain of sIgA1 and sIgA2, respectively, while sIgA2 also possesses 1 or 2 additional N-linked glycans on the CH1 domain. Another key structural difference is sIgA1 that contains multiple O-glycans on its elongated hinge region, while sIgA2 possesses a shorter hinge region that lacks such glycosylation.36 Both subclasses contain several N-linked glycosylation sites on the J-chain and SC.37 SDS-PAGE analysis was performed under nonreducing and reducing conditions, both with and without PNGase F treatment to remove N-glycans, as shown in Figure 1b. Under nonreduced conditions, both sIgA1 and sIgA2 mAbs displayed smear bands with a composition (based on migration within the gel vs. MW standards) of dimeric sIgA and higher molecular weight (HMW) species. The IgG1 sample migrated as primarily a single species at the expected MW of ∼150 kDa. For the sIgA1 and sIgA2 samples, the dimeric sIgA and HMW bands were shown to contain covalently cross-linked disulfide bonded species upon comparison to the reduced samples (consistent with previous reports).38-40 Under reducing conditions, 3 major components were identified for the sIgA mAb samples: the SC (∼70 kDa), heavy chain (∼50 kDa), and light chain (∼25 kDa). Although the J-chain (∼16 kDa) was not observed by SDS-PAGE (consistent with literature results; see Discussion), its presence was confirmed by LC-MS peptide mapping (see below). Specifically for sIgA2, we also observed 2 bands at relatively lower molecular weights (∼17 kDa and ∼40 kDa), which could represent a sIgA2 fragment (for the ∼17 kDa band), rather than J chain, due to their disappearance after reduction. The heavy and light chains of the PNGase F-treated reduced sIgAs migrated at slightly lower MW on the gel, indicating deglycosylation of these molecules. As expected, no migration differences were observed for the light chain bands independent of PNGase F treatment. By contrast, for the reduced IgG1 sample, both heavy (∼50 kDa) and light (∼25 kDa) chains were observed, and small amount of fragments (∼17 kDa) were also seen. Because the IgG1 heavy chain is N-glycosylated (see below), it also displayed lower MW migration after PNGase F treatment. To confirm the primary sequence and identify potential post-translational modifications (PTMs), LC-MS peptide mapping was performed with the 3 anti-LT mAbs. On account of the requirement for PNGase F treatment for successful chromatographic resolution (data not shown), contributions of the N-glycans were not evaluated, and this PTM was examined separately (see below). On account of the sequence similarity (>97%) of sIgA1 and sIgA2, including both the variable and constant regions, many peptides were similar in terms of elution profile (Fig. 2a). At the same time, some differences in peptide elution profiles were also observed thus demonstrating a unique profile for each sIgA. For IgG1, the base peak chromatogram was significantly different when compared to the sIgAs, indicating a distinct digestion profile. Therefore, “fingerprint” chromatograms were obtained for each of the 3 mAbs. The sequence coverage obtained for each of the polypeptide chains is shown in Figure 2b. Overall, >85% coverage was obtained for each polypeptide chain for each mAbs. The light chain displayed the best coverage (97%-100%), the heavy chain coverage was from 83% to 97%, and SC and J chain displayed 86%-87% and 83%-96% sequence coverage, respectively. In terms of PTMs, no notable chemical modifications on sIgA1 and sIgA2 mAbs were observed. For IgG1, N-terminal pyroglutamic acid formation and C-terminal lysine residual truncation were identified in the heavy chain, which are commonly observed PTMs with IgG1 mAbs.41,42 Glycosylation of antibodies plays an important role in functional activity (effector function and potentially antigen binding) as well as physical properties such as solubility and stability.43-46 A combination of total carbohydrate content as well as the identification and quantification of the N-glycan oligosaccharide profile was determined for each of the 3 anti-LT mAbs. As shown in Figure 3a, a substantial difference in the total carbohydrate content between sIgAs mAbs (18.7% and 18.5% for sIgA1 and sIgA2, respectively), and IgG1 (1.2%) was observed. This result is consistent with the known structure and post-translational modifications of each mAb (Fig. 1a). Further analysis was performed to identify specific N-glycan type and relative quantification was performed by removal and derivatization of the N-glycans followed by chromatographic separation with detection by a combination of MS analysis and fluorescence measurements (see Methods). Twenty-four and twenty-three different N-glycans for sIgA1 (Fig. 3b) and sIgA2 (Fig. 3c) were identified, respectively, with G2+NANA and G2F + NANA observed to be the most dominant glycan types. By contrast, as shown in Figure 3d, the IgG1 mAb displayed a much simpler N-glycan profile, with 5 major N-glycan oligosaccharides, in which glycan G0F was the most dominant type (>80%). Each N-glycan type and corresponding percent composition found in each anti-LT mAb are summarized in Figure 4. It can be seen that the N-linked oligosaccharide composition and distribution greatly differs between the sIgA and IgG1 mAbs, as well as between the sIgA1 and sIgA2 mAbs. In addition to size analysis under denaturing conditions by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 1b), size distribution profiles under nondenaturing conditions were determined for each of the 3 anti-LT mAbs using 2 orthogonal methods, SV-AUC and SE-HPLC, as shown in Figures 5a and 5b, respectively. Two size categories (main peak and higher-order molecular weight species) were used to classify the size distribution of each sample. To be consistent with literature nomenclature, the main peak of the sIgAs is referred to as dimeric sIgA while the main peak for IgG is simply referred to as IgG1. Multiple species were identified by both SV-AUC and SE-HPLC, with SV-AUC displaying superior peak resolution between the main peak and the HMW species. Overall, similar percent composition results were observed in comparing SV-AUC and SE-HPLC size distribution results after peak area integration (Fig. 5c). Both sIgA1 and sIgA2 samples displayed a combination of main peak (dimeric sIgA) as well as relatively higher amounts of HMW species in solution (∼50% and ∼80% of total protein peak area, respectively, for sIgA1 and sIgA2 samples). For IgG1, a more homogeneous peak distribution was observed (it should be noted that to optimize separation of different species and percent recovery, different SEC columns were used for the sIgA vs. IgG1 samples, and thus the IgG1 eluted at an earlier retention time; see Methods) with <10% of total protein peak area in the form of HMW species. For each of the observed species, the molecular weight values were estimated, based on sedimentation coefficient values and comparison to the gel filtration standards for SV-AUC and SE-HPLC, respectively. As shown in Supplemental Table S1, the estimated molecular weight values of the main peak were calculated to be ∼430 kDa (with values ranging from 414 to 441 kDa) for the 2 sIgA mAbs and ∼150 kDa for the IgG1 mAb. The sIgA1, sIgA2, and IgG1 mAbs were then compared in terms of their conformational stability and relative solubility profiles under 2 different pH solution conditions including pH 7.2 (to evaluate stability and relative solubility under storage conditions at neutral pH) and pH 3.0 (to evaluate stability and relative solubility under gastric conditions at acidic pH). First, the conformational stability of the mAbs was examined as a function of temperature. As shown in Figure 6a, solution pH effects the overall tertiary structure of the mAbs as a function of increasing temperature as determined by intrinsic Trp fluorescence spectroscopy. Each of the 3 mAbs has a similar lambda max value at 10°C and one major transition was observed to begin at 60°C-70°C at pH 7.2 for each of the mAbs. When the solution pH was decreased to 3.0, however, a red shift was observed at 10°C and multiple transitions were detected across the entire temperature range, and a red shift was observed at 10°C. These results suggest that the overall tertiary structure of each mAb is partially altered under acidic pH solution conditions and differences in their temperature melting profiles may be due to differences in partially altered structural states. Second, the conformational stability of the 3 mAbs was examined by the addition of increasing amounts of the chemical denaturant guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), by monitoring changes in overall tertiary structure of the mAbs by fluorescence spectroscopy as shown in Figure 6b. The sIgA1 and sIgA2 mAbs showed one broad transition as the GdnHCl concentration was increased with a midpoint of ∼3M at pH 7.2. At pH 3.0, both sIgA mAbs showed lower conformational stability. Two distinct transitions were observed for IgG1 at pH 7.2, with midpoints of ∼2 and ∼4M GdnHCl. Lower conformational stability was also noted at pH 3.0 for the IgG1 mAb. Finally, in terms of pH effects on size and aggregation profiles, a preliminary SV-AUC experiment (n = 1) was performed to compare results at pH 7.2 (PBS buffer) to pH 3.0 (SGF without CP buffer), and no notable differences in the percent area of the major peaks (see Fig. 5) were noted for either the sIgA1, or sIgA2, or IgG mAbs (data not shown). Interestingly, in terms of relative apparent solubility as measured by PEG-10,000 precipitation assay, a higher concentration of PEG-10,000 was required at pH 3.0 to precipitate each of the 3 anti-LT mAbs compared to pH 7.2 in the relative rank order of sIgA1 > sIgA2 > IgG1 (Fig. 6c). In fact, the sIgA1 remained soluble and failed to precipitate despite addition of the highest concentration PEG-10,000 (25%, w/v) when the solution pH was 3.0. Thus, higher relative apparent solubility was observed for each of 3 mAbs, albeit to various extents, by decreasing the solution pH from 7.2 to 3.0. To investigate and compare stability profiles of each of the mAbs under conditions that mimic oral delivery, we adapted an in vitro digestion model that focused on the gastric phase using simulated adult conditions for food digestion.33 In this adapted model, we scaled down the volume requirements and determined the most crucial experimental variables on mAb digestion rates including solution pH, digestion time, and pepsin concentration (data not shown). We fixed the solution pH to 3.5 (using a low concentration of 10 mM citrate phosphate buffer), optimized the pepsin concentration to 2000 U/mL, and monitored digestion in 1 mL solution as a function of time at 37°C (see Methods section). Three analytical techniques (ELISA, nonreducing SDS-PAGE, SE-HPLC) were used to assess the antigen binding activity, purity, and size of each of the anti-LT mAbs (and their degradation products) versus incubation time, respectively. First, the LT-antigen binding activity of each mAb was assessed by ELISA as a function of incubation time in the in vitro digestion model. The ELISA binding activity correlated well with antibody activities in functional assays including GM1 holotoxin assay and Y-1 pathology assay (data not shown). At time zero, the sIgA1, sIgA2, and IgG1 anti-LT mAbs bound the antigen in a concentration-dependent manner with a midpoint between 0.01 to 0.1 mg/mL mAb (Figs. 7a-7c, respectively). During incubation, a decreased signal (indicating decreasing amounts of mAb binding to the LT antigen) was observed for both sIgA1 and sIgA2. Nonetheless, no shift in the midpoint was noted and some antigen binding was still observed even after overnight digestion (Figs. 7A and 7B). By contrast, IgG1 lost its LT binding ability to a much greater extent (shift in the midpoint values as well as decreased total signal), and much more rapidly, when compared to the sIgAs (Fig. 7c). The majority of the binding capacity of IgG1 sample was lost after 5-10 min of digestion. To better compare these results across the 3 anti-LT mAbs, the percent loss of binding signal was calculated and the relative loss rates were then compared (Fig. 7d). For IgG1, the loss of mAb binding to LT antigen was rapid compared to the slower rates observed for both of the sIgAs. The coaddition of sodium bicarbonate buffer, which neutralizes the acidic pH leading to irreversible inactivation of pepsin,48,49 resulted in ∼100% retention of LT binding even after overnight incubation in the in vitro gastric digestion model as shown in Figure 7d. Second, nonreducing SDS-PAGE was performed on the same sIgA1, sIgA2, and IgG1 samples incubated in the in vitro gastric digestion model (Fig. 8). The intact sIgA1 mAb (containing dimeric sIgA and HMW species as described previously) was gradually digested, and a series of digestion byproducts were observed including a major species ∼100 kDa, which presumably corresponds to the F(ab’)2 fragment (Fig. 8a). After 3 h, sIgA1 degraded mostly to the ∼100 kDa species. This result is consistent with known Fc susceptibility to pepsin digestion into smaller MW peptides while the more resistant F(ab’)2 fragment remains intact.50,51 As expected, the intact sIgA1 species were essentially completely protected with coaddition of a sodium bicarbonate buffer (Fig. 8a). Overall, similar observations were made with the sIgA2 mAb as shown in Figure 8b; however, one difference was noted: in addition to the major digestion species of F(ab’)2, another protein species was detected at ∼50 kDa which was likely the Fab fragment. Addition of the bicarbonate buffer played a similar role in protecting sIgA2 from digestion by increasing solution pH. By contrast, IgG1 displayed an accelerated digestion profile when compared to the sIgAs (Fig. 8c). After the first time point (5 min), almost all the IgG1 was digested to F(ab’)2 fragments, and these remained after overnight incubation (Fig. 8c). The protective effect of bicarbonate buffer addition was also observed for IgG1. To more directly compare digestion profiles of the 3 mAbs by nonreduced SDS-PAGE, densitometry analysis of the native mAb band was performed (Fig. 8d). Although each of the intact mAbs were fully digested after overnight incubation (without addition of bicarbonate buffer), the rate of digestion of the sIgAs was much slower when compared to IgG1, indicating an increased resistance to acidic pH and pepsin digestion. Finally, SE-HPLC was also used to determine the size degradation profile of the 3 anti-LT mAbs (under nondenaturing conditions) by quantifying the decrease of the intact protein species and increase of the corresponding degradation products (Fig. 9). In this experiment, immobilized pepsin was utilized to easily remove the pepsin from the solution because pepsin coeluted with the sIgA degradation products in the SEC chromatograms (data not shown). Three major peaks were identified in the SEC chromatograms of the sIgA samples: the intact species (containing dimeric sIgA and HMW species as described previously), large fragments, and small fragments (Fig. 9a). Presumably, native protein is the intact species, while the F(ab’)2 and F(ab) are the large fragments and smaller peptide byproducts represent the small fragments. As shown in Figure 9a, digestion of intact sIgA1 was observed as a function of time where the main peak area decreased at each time point, while there was a concurrent increase in the large and small fragments. For sIgA2, similar trends were observed (Fig. 9b). For IgG1, 3 peaks were also observed; however, the digestion occurred more rapidly (when compared to the sIgAs) based on the reduction of the main peak area (Fig. 9c). To facilitate comparisons, the percent of intact mAb as a function of digestion time was determined. Both sIgA1 and sIgA2 demonstrated greater resistance to pepsin digestion when compared to IgG1, with no notable differences between sIgA1 and sIgA2 under these conditions (Fig. 9d). To better summarize and compare the stability results described previously as a function of solution pH and molecule type (sIgA1, sIgA2, IgG1), a “relative stability index” was determined (Fig. 10). Briefly, Figure 10 displays the results of the relative stability comparisons between the 3 anti-LT mAbs in terms of conformational stability at pH 7.2 and 3.0 (vs. temperature and vs. GdnHCl) as shown in Figure 10a, the relative apparent solubility at pH 7.2 and 3.0 as shown in Figure 10b, and finally, the stability profile during incubation in the in vitro digestion model (37°C, pH 3.5 with pepsin) as shown in Figure 10c. For each condition, 3 values (1, 2, and 3) were assigned to each of the 3 mAbs corresponding to their relative rank ordering in stability (highest, intermediate, and lowest). These values in Figures 10a and 10b were determined from the replotting of Figure 6 data as shown in Supplemental Figure S1. As shown in Figure 10a (top panel), the physical properties of the 3 mAbs at pH 7.2 were rank ordered as described previously, and then the results were combined (bottom panel). It can be seen that sIgA1 scored as having the best physical properties (combination of results from thermal and denaturant unfolding as well as relative solubility), followed by sIgA2 with intermediate behavior, and IgG1 as the least desirable properties overall. The same evaluation was carried out at pH 3.0 as shown in Figure 10b, and the same relative rank ordering of desirable physical properties was calculated at pH 3.0 with sIgA1 > sIgA2 > IgG1. Results of relative stability index during incubation in the in vitro gastric digestion model are shown in Figure 10c based on rank ordering the results from the ELISA, SDS-PAGE, and SEC analyses (see Figs. 7-9). The sIgA1 and sIgA2 mAbs showed an overall similar ranking in terms of relative stability under conditions that mimic oral delivery, with IgG1 displaying the lowest stability overall under these conditions. mAbs are widely used for treating a variety of diseases including preexposure prophylaxis (PreP) for infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, and cancers.52 Approximately 70 mAbs are now approved for various therapeutic uses by regulatory agencies, and the vast majority are comprised of the IgG1 antibody subtype and are administered to patients by parenteral injection (intravenous or subcutaneous routes) for systemic delivery. From a product development point of view, key structural attributes of this category of antibody drugs (parenterally administered IgG1 mAbs) are now well established including determination of primary structure and post-translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation), size and aggregation propensity, higher-order structural integrity, and in vitro potency evaluations including antigen binding, cell-based assays, and in some cases, effector function assays.53-55 Once established, these structural attributes can be closely monitored during manufacturing, storage, and transport of an IgG1 mAb to ensure product quality. In this work, we have evaluated some unique analytical and formulation development challenges with a different class of mAbs (secretory IgAs, sIgAs) for administration by a different route (oral administration for local delivery) for a different application (passive immunization to protect against enteric diseases in the developing world). Specifically, sIgA1, sIgA2, and IgG1 mAbs targeting heat LT, a major virulence factor of ETEC, were examined in this work. The potential therapeutic use of sIgAs for passive immunization is of particular interest because they are the predominant immunoglobulin isotype in tears, saliva, breast milk, colostrum, and mucosal surfaces such as the gastrointestinal as well as genitourinary tracts.25 Regardless of ultimate success of using anti-LT sIgA mAbs for passive immunization against ETEC infections in vivo (preclinical animal studies ongoing), generation of milligram quantities of these anti-LT sIgA mAbs provided the opportunity to evaluate sIgA mAbs in terms of pharmaceutical development challenges including preformulation characterization, stabilization, and formulation for oral delivery. One key challenge for performing the preformulation characterization and stability evaluations reported in this work was the limited amount of purified sIgA material available. Given the current preclinical stage of development, only ∼5-10 mg of material was available for this work. To this end, we first evaluated a series of analytical tools to assess structural integrity, post-translational modifications, size and aggregation, conformational stability, relative solubility, and antigen binding activity with minimal material. In addition, we aimed to perform many of these assessments under conditions of neutral pH as well as more acidic pH (using a scaled-down version of an in vitro gastric digestion model; see below). The main objective was to not only better understand the key structural attributes of sIgA mAbs when formulated for oral administration but also compare the results to the much more widely studied IgG1 mAb. This was accomplished by examining 3 anti-LT mAbs produced in CHO cells (i.e., sIgA1, sIgA2, and IgG1). A combination of LC-MS peptide mapping, N-glycan analysis, and size comparisons under denaturing (SDS-PAGE) and nondenaturing conditions (SEC and SV-AUC) confirmed the increased structural complexity and heterogeneity of sIgA compared to IgG1 mAbs including multipolypeptide chain composition and higher molecular weight of the dimeric sIgA mAbs, as well as their more abundant and complex glycosylation patterns. In addition, a larger relative percent of HMW species was demonstrated for both the sIgA1 and sIgA2 mAbs versus the IgG1 mAb. The sIgA mAbs were more physically stable and pepsin-resistant (during incubation at 37°C, pH 3.5) and thus are likely more suitable for patient administration by oral delivery. This result is not unexpected considering sIgA as the most abundant antibody isotype in external secretions and mucosal membranes.18,56 Based on these preformulation characterization results, 3 key structural attributes for sIgA mAbs were identified including (1) carbohydrate content including N-glycan oligosaccharide profiles, (2) size heterogeneity and aggregation, and (3) stability profile under in vitro conditions that mimic oral delivery as discussed in more detail below. The monitoring of these structural attributes during process development and scale-up geared toward lowering the cost of producing sIgAs (while maintaining product quality) will be of great importance to the overall success of this passive immunization approach. When considering the total amount of carbohydrate and N-linked oligosaccharide profiles, significant differences were observed between sIgA1 versus sIgA2 (∼18% total carbohydrate with 23-24 different N-glycan oligosaccharides) versus IgG1 (∼1% total carbohydrate with 5 different N-glycan oligosaccharides) expressed in CHO cells. It is expected the glycosylation pattern for sIgA mAbs will be a critical structural attribute to monitor because their heavily glycosylated nature facilitates antibody binding to various pathogens and receptors.37 For example, the N-glycans on the J chain are usually required for dimer or oligomer formation of sIgAs and can also bind to polymeric immunoglobulin receptors (pIgR).57 The SCs of sIgAs are also heavily glycosylated, and the wide range of N-glycans on the SC creates diverse glycan epitopes, which can function as targets for lectins and bacterial adhesins.37,58,59 As a result, glycosylated SC can inhibit bacteria adhesion and prevent the establishment of an infection.59,60 In addition, the galactose-terminating N-glycans are potential ligands for the asialoglycoprotein receptor that could mediate the clearance and half-life of IgAs.61,62 Although a relatively simpler N-glycan profile was obtained for IgG1, these glycans are required for maintaining protein stability, increasing solubility, maintaining Fc effector functions, and receptor binding (e.g., Fcγ).37,63 In terms of future work, analysis of the total carbohydrate content by mass spectrometry methods before sample manipulation will be of interest to determine. In addition, identification of the O-glycosylation profile for sIgA mAbs will need to be evaluated, both for process consistency as well as to better understand the role it may play in pathogen binding. Finally, batch-to-batch variability of the glycan profiles as well as their effects on sIgA mAb stability (in terms of overall flexibility of the hinge region and protection of the hinge region from protease digestion37) will be important topics to further study. As for size heterogeneity of these 3 anti-LT mAbs, the IgG1 mAb was relatively more homogeneous containing 91%-96% main peak with smaller amounts of HMW species (4%-9%) as measured by SE-HPLC and SV-AUC. By contrast, both sIgA mAbs contained lower amounts of the main peak (dimeric sIgA at 50%-57% for sIgA1 and 18%-22% for sIgA2), and had higher levels of HMW species (43%-50% for sIgA1 and 78%-82% for sIgA2). Because there are several cysteine residues in each J-chain that usually form both interchain and intrachain disulfide bonds, it is likely that disulfide bond scrambling (leading to formation of interchain disulfide bonds between the tailpiece and cysteine residues in the heavy chains) can occur.64,65 Thus, the J chain has the potential to be a hotspot for cross-linking oligomers for sIgAs.64-67 In this work and consistent with published data, the J-chain was not detected by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions,68 although it was readily identified by LC-MS peptide mapping. One possible reported explanation is that the J-chain remains associated with light chain of sIgAs as a complex and thus comigrated with the light chain,68,69 although we did not observe such a complex by SDS-PAGE in terms of MW migration in this work (Fig. 1b). It is expected that the presence and formation of HMW species observed in this work will be a key structural attribute to monitor in the future with various preparations of sIgAs. Aggregation is of concern with parenterally administered mAbs due to the loss of potency and the potential for anti-drug immune responses that limit efficacy and potentially affect safety.70 However, it is not known to what extent this would be a concern during oral delivery of sIgAs. In fact, the polymeric nature of sIgA may not necessarily be a negative attribute in terms of efficacy during oral delivery for passive immunization (as long as the mAb-based drug itself is not lost due to irreversible precipitation and no unwanted immune responses are generated). The biological potency of polymeric sIgAs has been previously reported to be preserved along with some protease resistance.71 Furthermore, polymeric sIgA may elicit intracellular signaling by binding to pIgRs and potentially inhibit intracellular virus replication.72-74 Interestingly, polymeric sIgA can display greater activity, when compared to dimeric sIgA, with regards to neutralizing toxins or whole bacterial cells, such as neutralizing proinflammatory antigens located in the apical recycling endosome.64,75,76 In addition, it has been recently revealed that the functionality of an sIgA against influenza A viruses is notably enhanced in a specific polymeric form (tetrameric) due to significant improvement of target breadth.34 Because it is likely that both covalent crosslinking as well as noncovalent interactions between sIgA molecules play a key role in formation of HMW species, future work will focus on better understanding of the mechanism(s) of aggregate formation during production and during long-term storage. The batch-to-batch variability of the percent content and size distribution of the HMW species for various sIgAs mAbs will also be of interest to further evaluate (both at time zero and during storage) as well as determining the effect of sIgA oligomerization on biological activity. The last key structural attribute identified in this work is the stability profile of sIgA1, sIgA2, and IgG1 mAbs under in vitro conditions that mimic oral delivery. We adapted a previously reported in vitro gastric model for evaluating the fate of various food products and supplements during transit through the digestive tract (see Methods).29 Owing to limited material availability, we focused our experiments on a scaled-down version of the gastric phase of digestion because this is the first major stage that is encountered in vivo with pepsin readily degrading proteins.77 As a preliminary formulation assessment, we also tested a bicarbonate formulation buffer, which has been successfully used as part of a rotavirus vaccination program during oral vaccination.33 The stability profile of the 3 anti-LT mAbs was monitored by ELISA, SDS-PAGE, and SEC. Although possessing a trend toward relatively lower binding affinity at time 0, sIgA mAbs showed greatly improved stability of antigen binding properties as measured by ELISA over 24 h incubation in the in vitro gastric digestion conditions (37°C, pH 3.5 in the presence of pepsin). The major digestion product after pepsin digestion was the F(ab’)2 fragment for each of the 3 mAbs as determined by SDS-PAGE and SE-HPLC. Nevertheless, the antigen binding values varied over time between the 3 mAbs. These observations indicate that not all F(ab’)2 fragments retained antigen binding activity to the same extent in comparison to the full-length, undigested mAbs. Potential conformational structure changes, allosteric effects, and glycosylation may influence these properties.56,78-81 In terms of future work with the scaled-down in vitro digestion model, sIgA stability profiles under conditions that mimic sequential digestion (e.g., oral, gastric, and intestinal phases) will be evaluated to better understand the stability profile of sIgA candidates under varying conditions that mimic the entire oral delivery pathway for local delivery to the GI tract. In addition, analytical techniques with better sensitivity and higher resolution, such as mass spectrometry, will be applied to assess the most sensitive sites for proteolytic digestion of the sIgA mAbs in the in vitro digestion model. In addition, this scaled-down in vitro digestion model can be used in the future to screen for formulation excipients that may help improve stability and retain potency during oral delivery. The concept was established in this work by demonstrating the protective effect of coaddition of bicarbonate buffer in terms of stabilizing the 3 anti-LT mAbs during incubation in the in vitro gastric digestion model (see Figs. 7-9). Smaller molecular weight protein therapeutic drugs (e.g., insulin) have been evaluated for systemic use by oral delivery82-84 and face several significant barriers including poor stability (due to acidic pH and digestive enzymes) and low bioavailability. It has been reported that advanced drug delivery systems can be used to improve oral delivery of insulin, for example, polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, liposomes, microspheres, or pH responsive complexation gels.82,84-86 By contrast, the goal of this work is local delivery of the sIgA mAbs to bind and neutralize ETEC in the GI tract. Thus, passive immunization with sIgA mAbs may be a more successful approach than systematic delivery by the oral route of administration. However, for passive immunization applications in low-income and developing countries, low-cost formulations of sIgA mAbs for treatment of diarrheal diseases are critical, making the use of complex formulations such as advanced delivery technologies described previously less desirable. To this end, future sIgA mAb formulation development efforts will focus on simple, low-cost liquid formulations that provide good long-term storage stability (ideally at room temperature), and concomitantly provide protection from acidic pH and proteases degradation during oral delivery, in a single final container. Ideally, such a low-cost liquid dosage form could be designed as an oral supplement during infant feeding. Based on results of this work, the commonly used PBS buffer formulation of sIgAs is not sufficient to meet these goals, so improved formulations will certainly need to be identified including optimization of solution pH and addition of excipients to minimize aggregate formation during processing as well as during long-term storage. In the shorter term, to facilitate first-in-human clinical studies of orally delivered sIgA mAbs in adults, stable refrigerated or frozen preparations of sIgAs, combined with bed-side mixing with additives to protect during oral delivery (for adults), can be considered. Thus, the analytical tools used in this work were selected for their ability to monitor key structural attributes of sIgA mAbs from a formulation development perspective. These tools can be used to not only ensure therapeutic sIgA mAb drug candidates are reproducibly produced but also can be formulated in a low-cost dosage form for oral administration, to pursue the long-term goal of protecting infants in the developing world against certain enteric diseases by targeted passive immunization.'\n"]}],"source":["sample = dataset[\"train\"].shuffle(seed=42).select(range(3))\n","\n","for row in sample:\n","    print(f\"\\n'>>> Title: {row['title']}'\")\n","    print(f\"'>>> abstract: {row['abstract']}'\")\n","    text = \" \".join(row['body_text'])\n","    print(f\"'>>> body_text: {text}'\")\n","    "]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# This is an attempt to concatenate the string before processing the data.\n","def conc_string(example):\n","  return {'text': \" \".join(example['body_text'])}\n","\n","dataset = dataset.map(conc_string)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":113,"referenced_widgets":["91ad5f6d681f4cba9d109d953509030c","d2172593984648b18863c84e48a5bc86","c1d1b652e3484e41b2818e8d23118fb9","d044378d9de3416397831b521f7a2e83","87eecfad97b64fdca7b24440dd4306c9","9e3865ed611047f6b2b37c6003086125","a6eb08934bb945e4942258f31d583864","7e526e3ea8a04b80a6026e2d6aaa0805","f305a422e84c404ab1527738f9a821cc","7d02f26b12494e3891d4533e17a68ff4","f12069f8a85f4dd28e2e56378bb6fa25","f6a5978188c44eb0ba8d4980de84f2af","08b6e34eb0b84efa82acce244fd756d9","e7c225c79baf4aa7aed7f27ee8ee10ee","b144ae6954f74ed3bcac2e6fe196b219","cfc45e5646b94240a5715160351ae763","4942737776d04873aca43686f28a558d","5c32eb0a01f9432f87a9f4ced7a60f6b","ce4e6d41a65a41f7ace0cc59ab46a1ce","ec8ae0bf66ff4cc7bd2d7e91e79651c1","ba328626e3dd4dcd9cb04d18126f8b0d","fd842f2e1da746ed9c88c97f9d37889a","a666bac280c34a13a07accd58698b20b","bdaf54f978b64ec6acc09607bb585a52","ed43ae040d14491289721dacea28ef48","20f49ad30eca48839967585a41a9f211","07290602bb754a589a08305260fa00cd","46a9c3b9e4b5433dba77cb4cc8e51eda","36c0b505050f4aa09d6f93e976ff937c","d50a563f9f8c45729b6288a757be18d8","02b0a6bcd7074436a2a140f40b2fdbf2","578f3bb7c0da466882d790b4bf70563c","7bfacfe9ed6d4bf29e20ca19d6a58d0d"]},"id":"HhR2pKlCVTXF","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1654759526444,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":29263,"user":{"displayName":"Masaki Eguchi","userId":"05302967311923195479"}},"outputId":"b757afd8-dff6-44db-eff4-1f29db2dcf14"},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["  0%|          | 0/32072 [00:00<?, ?ex/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"91ad5f6d681f4cba9d109d953509030c"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["  0%|          | 0/4008 [00:00<?, ?ex/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"f6a5978188c44eb0ba8d4980de84f2af"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["  0%|          | 0/4009 [00:00<?, ?ex/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"a666bac280c34a13a07accd58698b20b"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["sample[1]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"_vvZJiURWqwj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1654759539407,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":218,"user":{"displayName":"Masaki Eguchi","userId":"05302967311923195479"}},"outputId":"a58af9e9-c811-436a-9720-d3907c1f6165"},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'abstract': 'This paper presents a novel concept, a virtual metrology frame, for enhancing the dynamic performance of a machine tool with a flexible structural frame.

The significant fraction (90%) of machining error is cause by dynamic positioning error in a machine tool servo [1]; this positioning error results in a contour error on the machined part. In Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) type servo controllers, the most common controller used in industrial CNCs [2], tracking error contributes to error in position; tracking error occurs in a closed-loop control system due to an inability to follow rapidly varying position commands [3]. This error can be reduced by increasing feedback gains and servo bandwidth [4–7]; however, the amounts by which these parameters can be increased are limited by sensitivity to measurement noise and mechanical resonance excitation, respectively [4,7,8]. There are three important types of mechanical resonances that can limit machine dynamics [9]: actuator flexibility, guiding system flexibility, and frame flexibility. Actuator flexibility occurs when there is compliance between the motor and the load, typically where there is a gear in the system. Guiding system flexibility occurs when the driving force is not coincident with the center of gravity and stiffness is limited. Frame flexibility occurs due to servo-reaction forces causing dynamic deformation, resulting in frame resonance excitation i.e. a stressed frame. The problem of servo control limited by mechanical resonance in machine tools is well studied in literature, most references focus on actuator flexibility; few papers describe the problem of flexible frames [10–13]. Notch filtering is commonly used in industry to attenuate mechanical resonances in the control signal [14]; however this reduces the drives’ bandwidths, limiting its application in improving machine tool performance [15]. Pre-filtering trajectory techniques can be used to reduce machine structure excitation [16], however their implementation is challenging [8]. Impulse/jerk decoupling technology [17,18] utilizes a mechanical low-pass filter, which adds another degree of freedom to the system. An expansion to this technology, which is often used in the lithographic industry, is a dual stage motion system [19,20]. In this concept a fine short stroke motor with ultraprecision positioning is mounted to a coarse driving mechanism; however, this concept is complex and requires additional sensors, actuators, volume, and cost. Acceleration feedback was used for damping structural resonances [16,21,22]; by adding acceleration feedback to the position control loop, as an inner feedback loop, the disturbance force experiences a virtually larger mass, improving the process sensitivity [23]. Process dynamics, controller calculation delay, and accelerometer roll-off result in instability. Reducing the acceleration loop gain for higher frequencies counteract this instability; however to maintain position loop stability margins the acceleration loop requires a high bandwidth [21,24]. Controllers in industrial feed drives commonly use position feedback only, since other movement variables are not available [16,21], this limits acceleration feedback realization in commercial CNC. Acceleration can be measured directly by an accelerometer, calculated from the second derivative of position measurements, or by observer techniques. Using accelerometer provides absolute acceleration measurement; however, both rigid body and structural vibrations are mixed in the signal. Differentiation of position signal produces quantization noise [25], passing this signal through filters limits the closed loop control performance [26]. Acceleration observers offers lower noise content than differentiation, however these are limited by parameter dependence [26,27]. The position signal in a linear motion system is typically provided by a linear encoder which is generally located at the machine frame; hence, deformation in flexible elements anywhere between the encoder scale and the point to be controlled is not compensated [28]. In [29] an accelerometer located close to the Tool Center Point (TCP) is used. The TCP position is estimated by a state space observer, and used as position feedback, improving dynamic behavior; however, this implementation is non-trivial due to the non-collocated control [22]. In [8] a model-based control is used to estimate the machine frame deformation with respect to the TCP, where no additional drive is required; however, frequency and damping of structural modes may vary over time, and also as a function of machine configuration [16]. This paper addresses the problem of frame flexibility, which is often neglected in the design stage, thus leading to unexpected problems during the prototype test phase [10]. A virtual metrology frame technique was developed to achieve high dynamic performance as though the machine has a separate stiff metrology frame, by measuring machine frame displacement using an acceleration sensor. The developed technique was implemented on a commercial PID controller, while other structural resonance compensation techniques cannot be applied in commercial CNC systems [30]. The Virtual Metrology Frame (VMF) concept was designed to improve the performance of a machine with flexible frame phenomena that limit performance. The dynamic properties of the machine are directly affected by the stiffness of the frame and its reference system. By utilizing an unstressed metrology frame, superior dynamic capabilities can be achieved [10,19,31,32]. The VMF concept is realized (Fig. 1a) by distinguishing between the carriage position, with respect to the stressed frame Xc, and the frame displacement due to flexible modes Xf; hence, an unperturbed position signal Xvmf can be obtained in the presence of these frame flexible modes. A typical PID controller structure C can be applied using the VMF (Fig. 1b). A reference position signal Xset is fed into the controller C, with output u, the control signal. The plant P is the system to be controlled, it has input u, and output Xc measured by a position sensor, typically a linear encoder; however, in the VMF concept a second output to the plant Xf, the frame displacement, is added to Xc within the controller; thus, the controlled position signal Xvmf is the sum of the position measurement signals, enabling attenuation of the machine frame resonance. The VMF concept does not require physical components associated with a metrology frame, hence it is ideal for a compact size machine tool with the requirement for small footprint [33,34] and ultra-precision performance [35,36]. Furthermore, this concept is very suitable for industrial deployment as it allows implementation within an off-the-shelf controller without modification. The concept was simply implemented in a PID controller, which is the most common controller found in industrial machine tools [2,5,37]. The VMF concept relies on real-time measurement of the frame displacement – “frame displacement sensor” (Fig. 1b). Common techniques for precision displacement sensors require a fixed reference system [38,39], i.e. a secondary physical frame. A unique frame displacement measurement technique using accelerometers was developed [40], which offers a superior solution without a secondary physical frame. The accelerometer measures the acceleration of a point without a fixed reference system; thus, by double integration the frame displacement Xf can be estimated relative to its “unstressed state” (Fig. 1a). The VMF concept uses an accelerometer to measure frame displacement, thus it differs from acceleration feedback techniques as no special inner loop, i.e. acceleration feedback, is required; hence no special technique is required to tune the controller gains. Furthermore, the technique offers wideband frame resonances attenuation, and there is no “targeted” resonance to attenuate as in other common techniques [14]. The controller update rate is significantly lower than the encoder and frame displacement sensor update rates, thus the position feedback register (in the controller) is simply their sum according to (3); and no special sensors fusion technique is required. Real-time implementation of acceleration based displacement measurement in a control system has two main conflicting requirements: small phase error JP and low displacement noise Jσ; thus, it is rarely reported [44], especially for long term (>10 s) and accurate (<0.1 μm) measurements [45]. The estimator was constrained to measure only dynamic displacement of the machine frame that occurs at flexible resonances frequencies (>ωc); hence it optimize: the displacement noise Jσ, phase error JP, and magnitude error JM resulting from double integration of, and HPF application to, the acceleration signal [40]. The μ4 is a small size CNC machine with 6 axes which was conceived in 2008 by Cranfield University [36]. In order to reduce the machine footprint and ease manufacturing, the design was based on modules with common design and simple interfaces; thus, the machine motion axes were split into two near identical modules. Each module consists of at least one rotary, and one linear motions made by direct drive motors (Fig. 4). A simplified linear motion module [46], which represents one of the machine motion modules, consisting of: frame, air-bearings, linear motor, linear encoder, and carriage, was used for this study (Fig. 5). The driving force and the position sensor were not applied at the center of gravity but on the “master side”, thus, the carriage movement is dependent on the high stiffness of the air-bearings, which suppresses motion in an undesired direction. The carriage and the frame mass are mc = 17 kg and mf = 24 kg respectively. A software-based machine controller (Aerotech A3200) was used to control the motion system with a linear digital amplifier (Aerotech Ndrive ML). The digital servo amplifier has a current loop update rate of 50 μs, servo loop update rate of 125 μs, and a tunable PID digital control loop. The frame displacement sensor was connected to the auxiliary analogue input of the drive amplifier. Its update rate was equivalent to the servo update rate. Summation of the encoder and frame displacement signals was implemented in the controller (Fig. 1b). A linear encoder (Renishaw RELM 20U) with 20 μm pitch was used as the position feedback sensor. Using a controller multiplication factor of 65536, the position resolution was 0.30 nm, and sub divisional error was nominally <±30 nm [47]. System identification techniques [48,49] showed flexible frame characteristics, where a relative movement between the frame and the carriage is measured by the encoder (Fig. 6). These appear as resonances in the plant Frequency Response Function (FRF) as the encoder scale is mounted to the machine frame, while its read-head is mounted to the carriage (Fig. 5). To maintain co-located control, the accelerometer was fixed to the frame as close as possible to the encoder scale (Fig. 7), and aligned with respect to the encoder. The accelerometer location was chosen based on the machine modal analysis [48,49]. The frame displacement sensor was realized using a combination of: an accelerometer, signal conditioner, and an xPC target machine (Fig. 8). A triaxial ceramic shear Integrated Electronic Piezoelectric (IEPE) general purpose accelerometer (PCB 356A025) was used to determine the frame displacement. The accelerometer sensitivity was 25 mV/g. IEPE accelerometers are the appropriate sensor for low amplitude vibration measurements due to their: low noise; wide dynamic, frequency, and temperature range; high sensitivity; and availability in small sizes [50]. A low noise signal conditioner was used to power the IEPE accelerometer, and to decouple the acceleration signal (PCB 482C15). The signal conditioner has a typical phase distortion of ±1°. The xPC target machine (Speedgoat performance) was used for Digital Signal Processing (DSP) with an update rate of 18 μs. It contains 16 bit Analogue Digital Converter (ADC) and Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC). The conversion time for the ADC and DAC is 5 μs and 3 μs, respectively. The xPC target machine is optimized for MathWorks® SIMULINK® and xPC Target™. The frame displacement sensor delay, based on an optimized displacement estimator, is shown in Fig. 9. The frame displacement sensor was validated against a laser interferometer (Renishaw ML10 gold standard) [40] and capacitance sensors (Lion precision PX405HC) [42,43]. Displacement noise was σ < 30 nm over 10 min of measurement [40]. This section shows the experimental results validating the VMF concept, and comparison of the optimized controller with and without the VMF concept. The VMF concept was realized by connecting the xPC target machine output Xf to the machine controller. Summation of the two signals in the controller was set to the maximum update rate – the servo update rate of 125 μs. Using sinusoidal excitation the machine plant Transfer Function (TF) was measured. Comparison of the plant TFs with and without the VMF is shown in Fig. 10. A significant magnitude reduction of 12 dB in the frame’s first resonance can be observed. Furthermore, the VMF has been shown to be a wide bandwidth resonance attenuation technique. The second resonance shows no attenuation by this setup as its mode shape produced a non-collinear displacement to the measured axis; this second resonance causes a relative movement between the encoder read-head and scale which is measured as displacement and appears as a resonance, while the frame displacement sensor measures only collinear displacement to the measured axis. A PID controller (Section 4) was designed and optimized based on curve fitted plant TFs with and without the VMF (Fig. 9); a ‘peak picking’ curve fitting method [55] was used to curve fit the measured plant TFs. A Bi-quad filter (9) was used to attenuate the machine second resonance, with the following parameters: ζn = 0.0175, ζd = 0.2156, and fn = fd = 198 Hz. The optimization results of the PID filter gains are shown in Table 1. To aid in the comparison between the two optimized controllers, a vector margin stability criteria Ms was used [56]. Because the vector margin is a single margin parameter, it removes all the ambiguities in assessing stability using gain and phase margins. Implementing the VMF in the control system improved the proportional and derivative gains by 70% and 38% respectively, while the overshoot was reduced, and the stability margin remains almost the same (Fig. 11), thus, the open loop crossover frequency, i.e. servo bandwidth, was improved by 36%. The open loop Nyquist and Bode plots with and without the VMF concept are shown in Figs. 11 and 12. Three sensitivity functions determine the feedback error of the system: sensitivity function S(s), complementary sensitivity function T(s), and process sensitivity function PS(s) [57]: these functions represent the ability of the feedback system to reject disturbances acting on the output of the system; the system response to the reference in case Xset = 1; and the machine dynamic compliance respectively. The sensitivity functions with and without the VMF are shown in Fig. 13. When the VMF was applied, the machine dynamic stiffness (inverse process sensitivity) and sensitivity function were shown to be equivalent to the improved proportional gain. The Virtual Metrology Frame is a servo plant compensation technique to address frame flexibility. It offers a solution of enhancing machine performance utilizing a virtual metrology system, without a physical metrology frame. The developed concept is insensitive to plant frequency changes in contrast with common techniques. The VMF concept is based on a technique to measure frame displacement without having a fixed reference system. Using bespoke signal processing, an accelerometer was used as a precision positioning (displacement) sensor. Implementing the VMF concept on the linear motion system, the metrology loop showed superior rigidity; this was due to the virtual separation of the metrology system and the force system. The VMF was designed to measure encoder scale displacement that occurs due to frame flexible modes only; whilst floor vibrations and rigid body modes, which appear in the acceleration signal, are attenuated significantly by the HPF. The VMF concept could be implemented in a multi-axes system, such as CNC machine, for each motion axis independently; hence measuring the position of the carriage (or the tool) relative to the “unstressed state” of the reference frame. The effectiveness of the VMF concept in a multi-axes machine should be addressed in a future study. Furthermore, this technique could also be implemented in rotary axes by using angular accelerometers. The concept can be implemented in any feedback controller, requiring only a summing of two position signals: encoder and frame displacement; thus it very suitable for industrial deployment. It can be used to improve the performance of an existing machine with minimal retro-fit to the machine. In the future, the Speedgoat controller could be replaced seamlessly by dedicated lower cost electronics, such as a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and would be connected to the auxiliary analogue input in the controller. The concept was demonstrated on a simplified motion module of a commercial CNC machine equipped with a PID controller. The flexible frame resonances present in the position signal were attenuated significantly, but not completely. This can be explained by the fact that frame vibrations cause forced vibrations of the carriage; however, a significant improvement to the servo bandwidth and dynamic stiffness were shown, which are key parameters for improving the machining accuracy. These improvements were implemented with no affect upon the system stability.',\n"," 'title': 'Virtual metrology frame technique for improving dynamic performance of a small size machine tool'}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["sample = imdb_dataset[\"train\"].shuffle(seed=42).select(range(3))\n","\n","for row in sample:\n","    print(f\"\\n'>>> Title: {row['text']}'\")\n","    print(f\"'>>> abstract: {row['label']}'\")\n","    "],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"rkKdv2bN5N1V","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1654757462685,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":254,"user":{"displayName":"Masaki Eguchi","userId":"05302967311923195479"}},"outputId":"00d69618-c6db-448e-e1bc-94b189cc1712"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Loading cached shuffled indices for dataset at /root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/imdb/plain_text/1.0.0/2fdd8b9bcadd6e7055e742a706876ba43f19faee861df134affd7a3f60fc38a1/cache-f700cd6f222bd13f.arrow\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","'>>> Title: There is no relation at all between Fortier and Profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes.

sodium intake has been associated with cardiovascular disease. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and U.S. Department of Health and Human services (HHS) (2010) recommend daily sodium intake to be no > 2300 mg/day. An estimated 77% of daily sodium consumption comes from processed and restaurant foods (Mattes & Donnelly, 1991). Similarly, Anderson et al. (2010) reported 71% of sodium intake in the US is from processed foods but suggest that this likely underestimates the actual amount. Consequently, recent efforts have been made to reduce sodium content in foods and monitoring of commercially processed and restaurant foods has suggested that 43 of 73 sentinel food categories have had > 10% reduction in sodium (Ahuja et al., 2015). One difficulty in achieving further reduction of sodium is the multitude of sodium containing functional ingredients. Simply removing or reducing these compounds can negatively impact product quality, acceptability and shelf life (Ruusunen & Puolanne, 2005). Sodium chloride is an important multifunctional ingredient in processed meats. In meat processing, sodium chloride is used to extract myofibrillar proteins which is important for product binding and texture (Bombrun, Gatellier, Carlier, & Kondjoyan, 2014; Desmond, 2006). The addition of sodium chloride provides a salty flavor and enhances the other flavors of the product (Aaslyng, Vestergaard, & Koch, 2014; Tobin, O'Sullivan, Hamill, & Kerry, 2012a, 2012b). Through adding sodium chloride to raw meat products, a shift in the microbial population (spoilage and pathogenic bacteria) and delay in the rate of growth of these organisms occur (Blickstad & Molin, 1983; Madril & Sofos, 1985; Whiting, Benedict, Kunsch, & Woychik, 1984). The addition of sodium chloride improves moisture retention in raw meat and during cooking (Horita, Messias, Morgano, Hayakawa, & Pollonio, 2014; Tobin et al., 2012a, 2012b; Xiong, Noel, & Moody, 1999). Due to these functions, reducing sodium is not as simple as just reducing the amount of sodium chloride added. Therefore much work has been conducted to identify ingredients and processing technologies to replace the functionality of sodium chloride. Potassium chloride provides one of the most direct substitutions due to the similarity in molecular composition but its use can be limited due to negative sensory attributes. The chloride anion is responsible for myofibrillar protein extraction which helps with increased bind and emulsion stability. Protein extraction can be maintained with a 50% replacement of sodium chloride with potassium but this substitution amount also leads to reduced sensory attributes and overall acceptance by consumers (Horita et al., 2014). To achieve a similar perception of saltiness, 33% more potassium chloride than sodium chloride is required in an aqueous solution (Feltrin, de Souza, Saraiva, Nunes, & Pinheiro, 2015). Substituting sodium chloride with potassium chloride on a molar basis provides similar antimicrobial effectiveness against several pathogens: A. hydrophila, E. sakazakii, S. Flexneri, Y. enterocolitica, and three strains of S. aureus (Bidlas & Lambert, 2008). Even with the efforts to reduce sodium content of processed foods, use of potassium chloride has been limited due to bitterness and off-flavors that can be associated with its use. A patented process to produce a potassium chloride based crystal (Chigurupati, 2011) has been developed with the potential to more closely mimic sodium flavor and reduce negative sensory attributes associated with using potassium chloride salts. In the modification process, the potassium chloride is treated with citric acid and mixed with a maltodextrin carrier before being spray dried. One study investigated this modified potassium chloride based salt and summarized that sodium chloride could be partially replaced with the modified potassium chloride without negatively impacting protein extraction, yield, or texture of cooked sausages (Zhao & Claus, 2013). The previous study, like most others, has investigated substitution of sodium chloride with potassium chloride on a weight equivalent basis. The objective of this study was to evaluate sodium chloride reduction and replacement with potassium chloride based salts on a weight or molar basis on the sensory and physico-chemical and sensory properties of pork sausage patties. Boneless pork shoulder butts, USDA (2014) IMPS# 406A, were purchased from a regional distributor and stored frozen until product manufacture. All non-meat ingredients were provided by NuTek Food Science LLC (Minnetonka, MN). All products were formulated (Table 1) to contain 94.79% boneless pork shoulder butts, 1.14% breakfast sausage seasoning (BFSTK-BREAKTRAD-no salt, International Spices, Fremont, NE), and 0.02% rosemary oleoresin (5XT-W Herbalox Brand Rosemary Oleoresin Kalsec Inc. Kalamazoo, MI). Modified potassium chloride based salt (NTS; NuTek Salt 15,000, NuTek Food Science, LLC, Minnetonka, MN) contains 85% potassium chloride. The amount of sodium chloride and potassium chloride salts varied between treatment and water was adjusted to maintain equal batch weights. On a raw meat basis, all reduced sodium treatments contained 37.05% less sodium chloride. Treatments included: Control = sodium chloride (1.7%) control; Reduced sodium negative control (RS Control) = reduced sodium chloride (1.07%); NTS 1.2 = reduced sodium chloride (1.07%) with NTS (0.75%), weight replacement basis; NTS 1.5 = reduced sodium chloride (1.07%) with NTS (0.94%), molar replacement basis; KCl 1.0 = reduced sodium chloride (1.07%) with potassium chloride (0.63%). As the NTS 15000 modified potassium chloride contains 85% potassium chloride, the NTS 1.2 treatment represents sodium chloride being replaced with potassium chloride on a weight equivalent basis whereas NTS 1.5 represents sodium chloride being replaced on a molar equivalent basis. Three independent replications were manufactured on separate days. For each replication, pork was allowed to temper at 1–2 °C for three days prior to manufacture. Boneless pork shoulder butts were course ground through a plate with 9.25 mm holes (4734, Hobart Manufacturing Co., Troy, OH). All meat (21.55 kg) and non-meat ingredients and 5% dry ice were added and mixed in a dual action mixer (100DA70, Leland Southwest, Fort Worth, TX) for 90 s. As the control treatment was used for sensory panel evaluations, two 21.55 kg batches were mixed for the control per replication to ensure sufficient quantity of patties. After mixing, the two control mixing batches were commingled during grinding. The sausage mixture was reground through a plate with 4.76 mm holes. A patty maker (Protégé, Patty-O-Matic, Farmingdale, NJ) was used to from 76 g patties that were 9.25 mm thick and 98 mm in diameter. Patties were placed on Styrofoam trays and overwrapped in oxygen permeable polyvinyl chloride film to be placed in simulated retail display. Patties were removed from retail display and vacuum packaged on the appropriate day of sampling and were stored frozen (− 80 °C) until analysis for lipid oxidation. All remaining patties were stacked, crust frozen, and placed in a 1.5 mil polyethylene bag lined box and were kept in frozen storage (− 20 °C) until evaluation. For evaluations that were conducted on cooked samples, patties were tempered for 24 h in a 1–2 °C cooler and cooked on a 190 °C gas heated flat top griddle (HG4, Hobart Corp., Troy, OH). Patties were cooked for 2.5 min on one side, turned, and cooked for 2.5 min on the other side. Internal temperature was measured at the end of cooking with a T-type thermocouple and product temperature ranged from 73.9 °C to 79.4 °C. Proximate composition, sodium and potassium content, and pH were evaluated on both raw and cooked sausage patties. Moisture and ash content were measured using a LECO thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA 701, LECO Corporation, St. Joseph, MI). Total fat was determined as outlined by the AOAC method 960.39 (AOAC, 1990b) using the Soxhlet extraction procedure. Protein was measured using a LECO Nitrogen/Protein analyzer (FP-528, LECO Corporation, St. Joseph, MI) using 6.25 as a conversion factor (AOAC, 1990a). Measures for moisture, ash, and protein content were conducted in duplicate and fat content was conducted in triplicate. Samples were stored frozen for up to 166 days prior to analysis. To determine sodium and potassium content, samples were first ashed. Samples were dried at 100 °C in a drying oven for at least 30 min before being moved to an ashing oven maintained at 350 to 400 °C. After 15 min, the temperature increased to 520 °C and samples were allowed to ash for at least 2 h. Ash was dissolved and diluted to 50 ml. Dilutions of at least 5 mg/L ash in 0.1% nitric acid in water were prepared. Samples were analyzed by atomic absorption for sodium and potassium content using an external standard (0.1 to 10 mg/l sodium or potassium). Sodium:potassium ratios were calculated based on measured values. Samples were measured in triplicate. Samples were stored frozen for up to 49 days prior to analysis. Sample pH was measured using a calibrated pH meter (Orion 410APlus; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in a 10 g sample and 90 ml distilled water slurry. Measurements were conducted in duplicate. Sensory analysis was conducted by The Pennsylvania State University Center for Food Innovation. For sensory analysis, sausage patties were tempered overnight in a walk-in cooler (1–2 °C) and were cooked as described above on a gas fired flat top griddle (Model 260L-48, Vulcan-Hart, Louisville, KY). Panelists were in individual booths with white lighting. Panelists received hot patties (immediately after cooking) one at a time and in a random order. Samples were evaluated for overall appearance, sausage flavor, spiciness, saltiness, aftertaste, overall acceptability, overall texture, and overall liking using the following nine-point hedonic scale: 1 = Dislike Extremely 2 = Dislike very much 3 = Dislike moderately 4 = Dislike slightly 5 = Neither like nor dislike 6 = Like slightly 7 = Like moderately 8 = Like very much 9 = Like Extremely. Spiciness level and saltiness level were evaluated using the following five point just about right scale: 1 = Not Spicy/Salty, 2 = Slightly not Spicy/Salty, 3 = Just about Right, 4 = Slightly too Spicy/Salty, or 5 = Too Spicy/Salty. At the conclusion of the panel, panelists were asked to rank samples in order of preference from most preferred to least preferred. Two separate sensory comparisons were conducted to limit panelist fatigue during sampling. The first set of sensory panels compared control, NTS 1.2, and KCl 1.0 samples to compare modified and standard potassium chloride replacement of sodium chloride on a weight equivalent basis to full sodium sausage patties. The second set of panels compared control, RS control, NTS 1.2, and NTS 1.5 samples to evaluate the impact of sodium chloride reduction and replacement with modified potassium chloride on a weight or molar basis in sausage patties. Both sensory comparisons were conducted on each of the three replications. Patties were kept in frozen storage for between 21 and 63 days for the first sensory comparison and between 9 and 24 days for the second sensory comparison. The first sensory comparison (control, NTS 1.2, and KCL 1.0) had a total of 317 panelists (Gender: male = 56.8%, female = 43.2%; Age: 18–24 = 14.1%, 25–34 = 35.0%, 35–44 = 13.2%, 45–54 = 21.5%, 55–60 = 18.0%). The second sensory comparison (control, RS control, NTS 1.2, and NTS 1.5) had a total of 276 panelists (Gender: male = 52.2%, female = 47.8%; Age: 18–24 = 13.4%, 25–34 = 34.4%, 35–44 = 10.9%, 45–54 = 22.8%, 55–60 = 18.5%). Five cooked pork sausage patties from each treatment and replication were allowed to cool to room temperature. A 40 mm × 40 mm square shaped sample was removed from each patty, weighed (wt. range from 24.29 g to 33.59 g, average wt. 28.93 g), and sheared using a Lee-Kramer Shear cell. An Instron (Model 55R1123, Norwood, MA) with a 2500 kg load cell was equipped with a 10 blade shear cell with a cross head speed of 100 mm/min. The blades cleared the bottom plate to allow the force to return to baseline. Shear force (N; peak force) and total energy (J) were determined using the associated software (Bluehill Version 2.19, Instron, Norwood, MA). Shear force/g (N/g) and total energy/g (J/g) were calculated. Within each treatment and replication, the 5 measures were averaged for each trait. Samples were stored frozen for up to 72 days prior to analysis. To evaluate shelf life of raw pork sausage, patties were placed under simulated retail display held at 1–2 °C with 1000 to 1800 lx warm fluorescence lighting (Philips F32T8/TL741 Alto 700 series, Royal Philips Electronics, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Patties were randomly located and rearranged daily in the simulated retail display. For discoloration evaluation, duplicate patties from each treatment were placed on a Styrofoam tray and overwrapped with oxygen permeable polyvinylchloride film (Prime Source PSM 18 #75003815, Bunzl Processors Division, North Kansas City, MO;  oxygen transmission rate = 2.25 ml/cm2/24 h at 23 °C and 0% relative humidity; water vapor transfer rate = 496 g/m2/24 h at 37.8 °C and 90% relative humidity). A five person panel evaluated duplicate patties from each treatment for percentage discoloration daily for 15 days of simulated retail display storage. The experienced panelists were originally trained to evaluate discoloration in steaks using a pictorial reference of discoloration in 10% increments. The process was adapted to be used on ground patties. Each treatment was assigned a random 3 digit blinding code to minimize bias by the panelists. Objective color (CIE Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage L*, a*, b*) was measured using a Minolta colorimeter (CR-400, Konica Minolta, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) with a 2° standard observer and D65 illuminant daily for 15 days of simulated retail display. The colorimeter was calibrated daily using a standard white tile (according to manufacturer specifications) covered in the polyvinylchloride film described above. Calculations for a/b ratio (a*/b*), hue angle [(b*/a*) tan− 1], and chroma [(a*2 + b*2)1/2] were calculated according to guidelines of the American Meat Science Association (2012). Five additional patties from each treatment were placed on single patty Styrofoam trays and overwrapped with oxygen permeable polyvinylchloride film. One patty was removed from each treatment and replication on days 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 to evaluate for lipid oxidation. Lipid oxidation was measured on pork sausage patties with 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days of simulated retail display. Patties were removed from simulated retail display, vacuum packaged, and stored in a − 80° F freezer for up to 95 days until analysis. Pork sausage patties were homogenized with a waring blender (Model 51BL32, Waring Products Inc., Torrington, CT) in preparation for analysis. Thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS) were used to measure lipid oxidation (Buege & Aust, 1978) with modifications as described by Ahn et al. (1998). Samples were run in duplicate; measures within a treatment and replication were averaged. The project was conducted as a completely randomized design for traits that were measured at a single time point and a completely randomized split plot design when patties were evaluated over time during simulated retail display. Three independent replicates were conducted. Data were analyzed as using the PROC GLIMMIX procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC). For proximate composition, sodium and potassium content, and Lee-Kramer shear force, the effect of treatment was considered a main effect. For sensory analysis, treatment was considered a main effect and panelist a random variable. For color measures and lipid oxidation, the main effects of treatment and storage time and their interaction were evaluated. Storage time was considered a repeated measure using an autoregressive covariance structure. Means separation (P ≤ 0.05) was conducted using Tukey's multiple pairwise comparison adjustment. Product composition results can be found in Table 2. As expected due to sausage formulation, the control samples had the greatest (P < 0.001) sodium content and all other samples were similar in both raw and cooked sausage patties. In regards to potassium content, the control and RS control samples had lower potassium content (P < 0.001) than any treatment with potassium chloride salts (NTS 1.2, NTS 1.5, KCl 1.0). For cooked sausage patties, NTS 1.5 samples had the greatest amount of potassium (P < 0.001), followed by NTS 1.2 and KCl 1.0 samples, and both controls had the least amount of potassium. The ratio of sodium:potassium follows similar trends. In raw sausage patties, the control had a greater ratio (P = 0.003) than all other treatments which were similar. In cooked patties, the ratio was the greatest (P < 0.001) for control patties and followed by RS control patties. All patties with potassium chloride salts were similar and had the lowest sodium:potassium ratio. Related to the differences in sodium and potassium content, ash content varied among treatments. In both raw and cooked sausage patties, RS control treatments had less ash content (P = 0.001) than all other treatments which were similar. No differences existed (P > 0.34) for protein, moisture, or fat content among treatments in raw or cooked sausage patties. No treatment effects on pH were identified (P = 0.698). Results of the sensory comparison of the full sodium chloride control to samples containing modified potassium chloride (NTS 1.2) or standard potassium chloride (KCl 1.0) can be found in Fig. 1. Significant treatment differences were found for all traits evaluated (P ≤ 0.041). The control samples received among the highest ratings and were significantly higher than the standard potassium chloride samples for all traits measures (P < 0.05). However, both treatments with potassium chloride salts received ratings closer to “just about right” for saltiness level. The modified potassium chloride treatment (NTS 1.2) received intermediate values for all traits. It was similar (P > 0.05) to the control for liking of overall appearance, flavor, aftertaste, overall texture, and overall liking and was similar (P > 0.05) to the standard potassium chloride treatment for spiciness, spiciness level, saltiness, saltiness level, and overall texture. For overall acceptability and relative ranking, the NTS 1.2 treatment was intermediate and different (P ≤ 0.05) than both the control and standard potassium chloride treatments. The second sensory comparison was conducted to evaluate the impact reducing sodium chloride and replacing it with modified potassium chloride on a weight or molar equivalent basis (Fig. 2). Significant treatment effects (P ≤ 0.024) were identified for all sensory traits except overall appearance (P = 0.738). As with the first set of sensory comparisons, the control samples received among the highest sensory ratings for all traits. The control sample ratings were greater (P ≤ 0.05) than the reduced sodium negative control for all sensory traits except saltiness, overall appearance, overall texture, and ranking. Between the treatments with modified potassium chloride replacement of sodium chloride on a weight or molar equivalent basis, there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) however differences in relationship to the full sodium chloride or reduced sodium chloride control were identified. When modified potassium chloride replaced sodium chloride on a molar basis (NTS 1.5), samples were similar (P > 0.05) to the full sodium chloride control for flavor, spiciness, spiciness level, saltiness, saltiness level, aftertaste, overall texture, and ranking and were similar (P > 0.05) to the reduced sodium negative control for spiciness, saltiness, aftertaste, overall acceptability, overall texture, overall liking, and ranking. The weight equivalent replacement treatment (NTS 1.2) was only similar (P > 0.05) to the full sodium chloride control for spiciness level. It was similar (P > 0.05) to the reduced sodium chloride negative control for all traits except for saltiness level in which reduced sodium negative control received the poorest rating (P < 0.05). No differences (P ≥ 0.487) were found among treatments for Lee-Kramer shear measures of shear force or total energy (Table 3). Similarly, no differences (P ≥ 0.690) were found for shear force or energy when calculated on a per gram of sample basis (Table 3). For objective color measures, discoloration, and lipid oxidation, no significant treatment by days of simulated retail storage interactions (P > 0.336) were identified so main effects of treatment and days of simulated retail display were considered (Tables 4 & 5, respectively). Significant treatment effects for product lightness (L*, P = 0.029) and yellowness (b*, P = 0.037) were identified. The reduced sodium control treatment was the lightest colored but L* values were only significantly greater than NTS 1.5 treatment. For yellowness, NTS 1.5 was the least yellow but b* values were only significantly less than KCl 1.0 treatment. No significant treatment effects were found for redness (a*), a/b ratio, hue angle, or chroma (P > 0.07). No significant treatment effects were identified for discoloration or lipid oxidation (P > 0.68). During simulated retail display, L*, a*, a/b ratio, and chroma decreased with increased days of retail display (P > 0.001) and b*, hue angle, discoloration, and lipid oxidation increased (Table 6) with days of retail display (P > 0.001). While the use of potassium chloride as a sodium chloride substitute/replacement is not a new concept, efforts to modify potassium chloride salts to negate sensory effects is relatively novel. It is expected that the formulations of pork sausage with reduced sodium chloride had lower sodium content and with the addition of potassium chloride salts, potassium content increased. This was identified in both raw and cooked pork sausage patties. Furthermore, these impacted the sodium:potassium ratios. It has been suggested that a total dietary sodium:potassium ratio should be < 1.0 and greater ratios can result in increased mortality (Yang, Liu, & Kuklina, 2011). The ratio of these molecules may be more indicative of mortality than either independently. All treatments containing potassium chloride salts had a sodium:potassium ratio meeting the recommendations (Table 2). The overall proximate composition of these products only varied in ash content where the RS control product was lower than all other treatments. No differences were found in protein, moisture, or fat content. As this was found in both raw and cooked products, it suggests the treatment did not impact composition during cooking. This is supported by findings of no difference in cooking loss in pork patties with a potassium chloride replacing 40% of sodium chloride (Moon, Kim, Jin, & Kim, 2008). Others reported a reduction in cooking loss when using 1.0% potassium chloride but no differences when 0.5% or 1.5% potassium chloride was formulated in pork patties (Davaatseren, Chun, Cho, Min, & Choi, 2014). The concern with potassium chloride inclusion is the reduction of product palatability. Partial replacement of sodium chloride with potassium chloride in pork patties has been shown to reduce relative ranking for sensory characteristics (Davaatseren et al., 2014). In comparing sausage patties with standard potassium chloride and modified potassium chloride, sausage patties with modified potassium chloride had improved sensory ratings for flavor, aftertaste, overall acceptability, and overall liking in the present study. Previous research using a different modified potassium chloride has indicated that replacement of up to 75% of sodium chloride with modified potassium chloride in pork sausage resulted in no differences in degree of liking of product (Pasin et al., 1989). The use of modified potassium chloride can improve palatability in comparison to using standard potassium chloride in pork sausage. When looking solely at molecular weights of sodium chloride (58.44) and potassium chloride (74.55), 27.5% more potassium chloride must be used to provide the same molar concentrations; however, all previous research on pork sausage has investigated equal replacement on a weight basis. In the current study, the comparison of replacing sodium chloride with modified potassium chloride on a weight or molar basis resulted in no significant differences between samples for sensory traits. However, samples formulated with replacement on a molar basis were more similar to the full sodium chloride control than those formulated weight based replacement ratio. While consumer panelists detected differences in overall texture, no differences were found in total compressive load or energy to shear sausage patties using a Lee-Kramer shear apparatus. Others have reported increased hardness during compression of pork patties containing 0.5% potassium chloride but not in patties formulated with 1.0% or 1.5% potassium chloride (Davaatseren et al., 2014). In cooked pork sausage links without sodium phosphates, no differences were reported in texture profile analysis measures between treatments containing only sodium chloride or a combination of sodium chloride and modified potassium chloride based salt (Zhao & Claus, 2013). Raw pork sausage patties in simulated retail display had limited differences due to treatment. The reduced sodium chloride control treatment was lighter colored and the standard potassium chloride treatment was more yellow than treatments where modified potassium chloride salt replaced sodium chloride on a molar basis. No other differences in objective color measures or discoloration due to treatment were identified. Previous studies found no difference in lightness or redness of salted raw pork due replacing 50% of sodium chloride with a modified potassium chloride based salt (Zhao & Claus, 2013). Similarly, Moon et al. (2008) reported no differences in objective color measures when partially replacing sodium chloride with standard potassium chloride. In contrast, others have reported replacing sodium chloride with standard potassium chloride at greater amounts resulted in salted pork patties that were less red and less yellow in color (Cheng, Wang, & Ockerman, 2007). In the present study, lipid oxidation during simulated retail display was not different among treatments. This is in contrast findings in previous studies. Cheng et al. (2007) found less lipid oxidation when 50% of sodium chloride was replaced with potassium chloride and Moon et al. (2008) found less oxidation in treatments replacing 40% of sodium chloride with potassium chloride on days four and eight of storage. The differences in reported lipid oxidation may in part in part explained by the addition of oleoresin of rosemary as an antioxidant in the present study whereas the was no antioxidant as included in the other studies. The findings of the present study suggest that the use of modified potassium chloride based salts can be used as a partial replacement for sodium chloride in pork sausage patties. Their use can reduce sodium content, increase potassium content, improve the sodium:potassium ratios, and have limited impact on other physico-chemical traits. The full sodium chloride control samples were among the highest rated samples for all sensory traits including overall acceptability and overall liking. However, consumer panelists indicated that the modified potassium chloride salts had improved palatability in comparison to standard potassium chloride and that using a molar equivalent replacement rate may result in samples more similar to full sodium chloride control.\",\n"," 'Although there is strong evidence that wild plant traits can influence insect predators and parasitoids directly (Wäckers et al. (2013)) and indirectly (Fortuna et al., 2014), studies on the effects of domesticated crop traits on these agents of biological control are scarce, especially in large-scale field experiments. Consequently, rather than optimizing focal crop traits, current Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices rely on intercropping with companion plants (Bickerton and Hamilton, 2012), flower strips (Tschumi et al., 2015), or other habitat manipulation approaches (Landis et al., 2000) in order to provide biocontrol agents with plant-based food. However, optimising focal crop traits may provide powerful new tools for efficient IPM (Stenberg et al., 2015). As we learn more about the ways in which domestication affects the rewards that predators derive from crops, it is becoming increasingly clear that predators and parasitoids can be affected by the specific cultivar, or cultivar mix, that is used in a plantation (Chen et al., 2015). It is therefore important to identify appropriate plant genetically based traits that can directly reduce herbivory or improve the biological control of herbivorous pests. Utilizing genetically based plant traits to control pests requires the selection of traits, such as secondary chemistry, herbivore-induced volatiles, nectar, and structural defences, that lead to the desired effects. Plant sex is often an important trait structuring herbivory (Cornelissen and Stiling, 2005) in wild plants. Predation can also be affected by plant sex (Kabir et al., 2014; Mooney et al., 2012), and studies on its potential utility in IPM programs including dioecious crops are therefore merited. Previous studies have shown that wild male and female plants can differ with respect to both resistance and rewarding traits (Bañuelos et al., 2004; Boecklen et al., 1990; Bullock, 1984; Pollard and Briggs, 1984). In concert with other types of trait variation, sex ratios various types of trait variation of crops could therefore be manipulated in domesticated plants to improve crop protection. Intersexual differences in resistance and rewarding traits can affect insect herbivores and can be expected to affect omnivorous natural enemies of the herbivores. One proposed mechanism for male-biased herbivory is that higher reproductive costs for female plants have led to females evolving better defences, because females can derive greater fitness gains from investing resources in defences than through investment in growth (Lloyd and Webb, 1977). However, exceptions to male-biased herbivory in dioecious plants are common (reviewed by Cornelissen & Stiling 2005) and for dioecious species little work has been done on the natural enemies of herbivores that can play an important role in IPM, suggesting that research is needed and sex differences cannot be assumed. Plant nutritional quality may affect herbivores and their omnivorous predators differently, as herbivores are generally limited by nitrogen sources such as amino acids (Mattson, 1980), and because they may feed on different plant tissues (e.g. nectar or leaf tissue). In addition, quality of herbivores as prey may vary with host plant quality (Chen et al., 2015). Pollen and nectar, important food resources for both herbivores and their natural enemies, including both predators and parasitoids, often vary in nutritional value among plants and could therefore influence biological control as well as herbivory, offering opportunities for crop breeding (Stenberg et al., 2015). Domesticated plant species from the Salicaceae family are commonly used in short rotation forestry as bioenergy crops, but the fact that most species in this family are dioecious (Renner 2014: S1) is largely ignored by breeders and farmers. However, sex-biased (most commonly male-biased) herbivory has been commonly observed, likely due to females being better-defended (Cornelissen and Stiling, 2005), indicating the need for further research on its significance in domesticated crops. In this study we investigate whether using plants of one sex or the other can reduce herbivory (directly, or indirectly via natural enemies) in Short Rotation Coppice of common osier (Salix viminalis L.). Short Rotation Coppice is a practice in which an energy forest is repeatedly grown for 3–5 years and harvested, over a period of approximately 20 years. Blue willow beetle (Phratora vulgatissima L., Chrysomelidae), the most serious insect pest of willow (Salix spp.) and poplar (Populus spp.) in Short Rotation Coppice (Peacock et al., 2001), prefers female plants of the wild crop relative Salix cinerea in natural populations (Kabir et al., 2014). Notably, it does so even though predation rates on female plants from the common flowerbug (Anthocoris nemorum L.), an anthocorid that is an omnivorous predator which feeds on P. vulgatissima eggs and Salix spp. nectar, are higher (Kabir et al., 2014). Such effects on insect preference and performance indicate that manipulating plant sex may be a powerful component of the IPM toolbox for Salix. For example, if higher predation rates reduce pest abundances on plants of either sex, biological control may be improved by using cultivars of that sex only. Another possibility is that mixing male and female plants in the same field (as a means of intra-specific intercropping to increase biodiversity) would promote biocontrol and reduce herbivory. However, an observational study surveying monoculture S. viminalis plantations for the effects of plant sex on a number of insect herbivores, albeit excluding the most important pest, P. vulgatissima, found no clear effects (Åhman, 1997). It has therefore been unclear whether, and how, S. viminalis sex affects herbivory by P. vulgatissima and biological control of P. vulgatissima by its predator A. nemorum. We investigated whether manipulating plant sex in S. viminalis plantations can reduce herbivore damage by P. vulgatissima and improve the biological control exerted by A. nemorum. To assess herbivory and biological control we planted a large-scale field experiment comparing monosexual male, monosexual female and mixed sex plots, and recorded the abundances of the two insects over three seasons. In addition, we performed a series of greenhouse and laboratory experiments in which we estimated plant sex effects on insect preference, development, survival, consumption, oviposition and predation. Based on previous findings with P. vulgatissima and A. nemorum (Kabir et al., 2014), we hypothesized that (i) abundances of the herbivore and omnivore should be higher on female S. viminalis, and that (ii) monosexual female fields should host greater abundances of both insects than male fields, with mixed-sex fields having intermediate abundances. We further hypothesized that (iii) insect performances would be better on female plants. Consequently, we expected that the herbivore P. vulgatissima and predator A. nemorum and would (iv) choose female plants in an arena setting, and prefer to (v) feed and (vi) oviposit on female plants. Salix viminalis is a woody Salicaceae species used as a bioenergy crop and grown in Short Rotation Coppice in agricultural fields. For economic and environmental reasons, pesticides are not applied to Short Rotation Coppice fields (Stenberg et al., 2010), although biomass reductions of up to 39% due to herbivory have been recorded (Björkman et al., 2000), and experimental mechanical defoliation can reduce shoot diameter at a height of 1 m by as much as 72% (Bell et al., 2006). Both male and female S. viminalis produce floral nectar that is consumed by pollinators and omnivorous predators. It is not known whether nectar quality of S. viminalis to the predator A. nemorum, or other consumers, differs between plant sexes. In Sweden, S. viminalis is naturalized (Hylander, 1971). Phratora vulgatissima, a leaf-chewing chrysomelid beetle, is the most serious pest of S. viminalis in energy forestry (Peacock et al., 2001), and finding effective integrated pest management strategies is crucial in reducing losses due to herbivory. The predator, A.s nemorum, is one of the most commonly occurring enemies of the pest P. vulgatissima. A. nemorum is an omnivorous true bug (Hemiptera) that emerges in adult form before P. vulgatissima adults in spring. It can feed both on Salix spp. nectar and on P. vulgatissima eggs. Anthocoris nemorum has negligible effects as a herbivore on S. viminalis (Lauestein, 1979), but its survival and egg consumption are affected by host plant genotype (Stenberg et al., 2011). We used male and female S. viminalis clones originally collected from Swedish naturalized populations in our experiments. Cuttings were collected in February 2013 and 2014 from experimental plantations outside Uppsala, Sweden, and kept in −5 °C dark rooms prior to planting. All soil used for plants in the greenhouse was sterilized in a microwave oven at 900 W. Pots used in the greenhouse measured 11 × 11 cm and were 12 cm tall. The greenhouse was kept at 20 °C with 18 h of supplemental light and plants were supplied with nitrogen fertilizer approximately once per week. Greenhouse experiments were started six to ten weeks after planting and no more than one experiment was performed in a given greenhouse at any one time. Plant placement in the greenhouse was always randomized. To test for the effects of S. viminalis sex on the abundances of the herbivore P. vulgatissima and the predator A. nemorum, we performed a field experiment in which plant sex was used as an individual plant treatment and plant sex composition was used as a plot treatment. In May 2013, we planted two cuttings of each of 20 clones (40 plants) per plot in 30 plots outside Uppsala, Sweden (Latitude: 58 °83, Longitude: 17 °78, Fig. 1.). Plots were randomly assigned to one of three plot treatments (male only, female only or mixed) in a block design with 10 blocks consisting of 3 plots each (Fig. 1). Plots within blocks were spatially adjacent to each other, with an exception for plot 9, which was separated from plot 7 and 8 because of spatial limitations. The plots comprised 20 male clones, 20 females or a balanced mix of 10 randomly selected clones per sex. Because we wanted to minimize insect movement among plots after colonization, we planted with a minimum distance of 180 m between the closest plots. Cuttings were planted in grids at distances of 70 cm, as is common practice in commercial plantations (Moritz et al., 2016), and plots measured 10 × 10 m. The spatial arrangement of all clones within plots was random. Because all experimental plants experienced roe deer herbivory during the first growing season, we cut the shoots down to the planted cuttings, fenced each plot and let new shoots grow during the growing seasons of 2014 and 2015. To count the abundances of P. vulgatissima and A. nemorum, we visually scored one randomly selected shoot per plant once in 2014, on three occasions in 2015, and once in 2016. To assess which plant sex is more likely to be visited by nearby adult P. vulgatissima herbivores at first encounter when both plant sexes are present, we performed a choice experiment using a lab population originally collected outside Uppsala, Sweden. In a net cage (base 40 × 40 cm, height 78 cm) we placed one male and one female plant with a Styrofoam “bridge” between them. We released one beetle on the middle of the bridge and recorded whether the beetle was present on the male or female plant 30 min after release. In total 20 male and 20 female plant genotypes were used. Each genotype was used twice but in unique male-female pairs for each replication. We performed 40 replications with unique beetles and male-female pairs in each replication. The bridge was swabbed with ethanol between replicates to remove any traces of volatile compounds left by the beetles. To test for leaf consumption by leaf beetle larvae not presented with any choice, we placed three larvae hatched during the previous 24 h on a male or female S. viminalis leaf in 2014. We used 19 plant genotypes per plant sex, one plant individual per genotype constituting an experimental replicate, collected in 2014 and grown in the same conditions as the plants used in the choice experiments. Each leaf, with three newly hatched P. vulgatissima larva, was enclosed in a cylindrical (height 4.2 cm, top ø6.9 cm, bottom ø5.6 cm) plastic cup with narrow holes permitting airflow but preventing escape of the larvae. After 48 h the experiment was terminated and each leaf was photographed alongside 0.5 cm2 graph paper and the survival, mass and length were recorded for each larva. We analysed the leaf areas consumed using the software package ImageJ by standardizing measurements against the known scale in one photograph per replicate. To assess oviposition preferences, we randomly placed 19 male and 19 female S. viminalis, grown as in the choice experiment for six weeks, in a cage (base 60·160 cm, height 108 cm) with mesh net walls, and released 38 leaf beetles (19 of each sex), which were evenly distributed across the corners of the cage. Distances were approximately 3 cm between plant pots and neighbouring plants were in contact with each other. After ten days, we recorded the number of beetles that were present on each plant, counted the number of P. vulgatissima eggs and photographed each leaf that had been attacked. We quantified herbivory by image analysis as in the feeding experiment. To assess whether the herbivore P. vulgatissima grew larger and/or faster (i.e. antibiosis) when feeding on S. viminalis of either sex, we placed individual larvae on leaves from 20 male and 20 female genotypes and enclosed each in a plastic vial (ø3 cm, 7 cm height) with a perforated lid. Each clone was used for one replicate only. A moist foam base kept humidity at a level where the leaves stayed fresh for at least two days and the larvae did not drown. The vials were randomly placed in growth chambers at 20 °C with 18 h of light per day. The leaf of each vial was replaced every second day and the dates of pupation and reaching the imago stage were recorded. We weighed each larva when it pupated and when it emerged as an adult using a Mettler Toledo MX5 microbalance (0–5.1 g ± 1 µg). We replaced larvae that died before pupation and restarted the experiments for the corresponding plant genotypes. To assess whether the omnivorous predator A. nemorum developed faster and/or survived longer when feeding on S. viminalis plants of one sex or the other, we collected branches from 25 female and 21 male genotypes from the clone archives used in other experiments described in the present study. Twenty-eight of the genotypes were not the same as those used in the field experiment, because other genotypes were more easily collected from nearby clone archives at that time. Because the predator A. nemorum primarily forages on Salix spp. in spring and early summer, we performed the experiment during the S. viminalis flowering season and included only twigs with nectar-producing catkins. We placed the green parts of the twigs in dry plastic mugs (ø9 cm, height 20 cm) with the basal part of each twig exiting through the bottom and entering a similar mug filled with water, through a hole between the mugs, to provide water to the plant while minimizing the risk of the insects drowning (Kabir et al., 2014). The lid of each dry mug was perforated. The replicates were randomly placed in climate chambers as described for the performance experiments on P. vulgatissima. We released newly hatched A. nemorum originating from a population outside of Uppsala, Sweden, and recorded survival after 15, 19 and 26 days. To experimentally test whether plant sex has any effects on predation efficiency (number of eggs consumed over a specified time) by A. nemorum on the herbivore P. vulgatissima, we grew one plant of each of the 19 male and 20 female experimental plant genotypes in greenhouses as described above. Plants were covered with perforated plastic bags so that insects would not escape the experimental setting. We released one mated P. vulgatissima female per plant and recorded the first day of oviposition, after which we released one adult A. nemorum predator on each plant. Number of eggs, and clutches laid per day by the herbivore varied among replicates but there was never a complete egg predation. Consumed and intact eggs are easily distinguished based on appearance (Stenberg et al., 2011), and we counted numbers of intact and consumed eggs one week after introduction of A. nemorum. We terminated the experiment when the A. nemorum individuals died, and counted the number of days that each A. nemorum survived. All statistical testing was performed using the statistical software package R (R Development Core Team, 2015). To test for the effects of plant sex and plot sex treatment on the abundances of adult P. vulgatissima herbivores and A. nemorum predators, we used the glmer function in the lme4 package (Bates et al., 2014) to construct generalized linear models with a Poisson family and a log link. Insect abundances, in 2014 and 2015 for P. vulgatissima and in 2014 for A. nemorum, were used as response variable, and plant sex and plot sex treatment were used as fixed factors to capture effects of individual and neighbourhood sex effects Date, block, plot nested within block and position within plot were used as random factors. For the P. vulgatissima abundances, a repeated measures design was used, where S. viminalis individual was used as a random factor. The same model was used to test for effects on P. vulgatissima larvae. Because A. nemorum was only present at one occasion, no repeated measurement term was necessary for modelling its abundance. We tested for P. vulgatissima plant sex choice with a χ2-test. In two cases, no plant was chosen, and we excluded these replicates from the analysis. To assess the effects of plant sex on P. vulgatissima larval feeding area (mm2), we used a linear model with the area consumed as a response variable, and plant sex and number of surviving larvae as fixed factors. To test for effects of plant sex on P. vulgatissima adult feeding area (mm2), we used a t-test. We used a Generalized Linear Model with a Poisson error family and log link to test for plant sex effects on P. vulgatissima oviposition, both in the herbivore oviposition experiment (2.5) and the omnivore egg predation experiment (2.7). Egg number was used as response variable and plant sex as factor. To test for the effects of plant sex on performance, we also used t-tests to compare development time (days) and weight (mg) at the pupal and adult stages for P. vulgatissima that had been fed male and female leaves. In order to test for the effects on A. nemorum survival over time, as a measure of performance, we used a generalized linear mixed model with a binomial error family and a log link, in which survival was used as a response variable, plant sex as a fixed factor and time as a random variable. Differences in A. nemorum egg predation rate between male and female plants were tested in a generalized linear model with a Poisson distribution and a log link, with eggs consumed being used as a response variable, plant sex as a fixed factor and total number of eggs as a random variable. We used a t-test to test for differences in A. nemorum survival when bagged with P. vulgatissima eggs on male and female plants. In the field we did not observe any differences in insect abundances between plants of different sexes or among the sex treatments (male, mix or female) of plots. The abundance of adult P. vulgatissima herbivores did not differ between plants of different sexes (χ2 = 0.29, P = 0.59, d.f. = 1), or among plot sex treatments (χ2 = 0.30, P = 0.86, d.f. = 2), over the 2014, 2015 and 2016 field seasons (Fig. 2). There were also no differences in abundance of P. vulgatissima larvae between sexes (χ2 = 0.17, P = 0.68, d.f. = 1) or among plot sex treatments (χ2 = 0.12, P = 0.94, d.f. = 2). In total, we found 41 P. vulgatissima herbvores in July 2014, 42, 17 and 5 individuals in June, July and August 2015 respectively, and 74 in June 2016. The abundances of Anthocoris nemorum predators were also unaffected by plant sex (χ2 = 0.60, P = 0.44, d.f. = 1) or plot sex treatments (χ2 = 2.11, P = 0.35, d.f. = 1) in 2014, when, in total, 23 individuals were found. In June, July and August 2015, and in June in 2016, no A. nemorum were found in field plots. Phratora vulgatissima did not show preferences for either sex in our cafeteria experiment (χ2 = 1.6, P = 0.21, d.f. = 1). Twenty-three beetles were recorded on female plants and 17 on male plants. We found no effects of plant sex on the extent to which P. vulgatissima herbivores fed on S. viminalis. Phratora vulgatissima larvae that were raised on S. viminalis leaves did not consume different areas of leaves on the two plant sexes (t = 0.89, P = 0.38, d.f. = 1). Adult beetles fed with designated plant genotypes did not consume different leaf areas on male and female plants (t = −1.18, P = 0.24, d.f.=1) when they were fed only one genotype. In addition, P. vulgatissima did not feed more on plants of one sex or the other when presented with a choice (t = −0.93, P = 0.36). Mated female P. vulgatissima herbivores preferred to oviposit on female S. viminalis when presented with a choice (z = −2.05, P = 0.04, d.f. = 1), but they did not feed more (t = 0.93, P = 0.36, d.f. = 1), and were not more frequently present, on plants of one sex or the other (z = −0.24,P = 0.82, d.f. = 1). In total, 285 eggs were found on female plants and 238 on male plants. Effects of plant sex on performance differed between the two insect species. Anthocoris nemorum predators showed higher survival over time when feeding on flowering Salix viminalis female twigs than on flowering male twigs (χ2 = 3.88, P = 0.05, d.f. = 1, Fig. 3). However, plant sex had no effect either on duration of development until pupation (F = 0.22, P = 0.64, d.f. = 1) or the imago stage (F = 0.54, P = 0.47, d.f. = 1), or on weight of the pupal (F = 3.26, P = 0.08, d.f. = 1) or adult (F = 0.009, P = 0.93, d.f. = 1) form of P. vulgatissima herbivores. Furthermore, survival up to the imago stage for P. vulgatissima was unaffected by plant sex. We found no effects of plant sex on adult A. nemorum in the predation experiment with three trophic levels. The risk of a P. vulgatissima egg being eaten by A. nemorum in the predation experiment was not affected by plant sex (t = 0.31, P = 0.76, d.f. = 1). Furthermore, P. vulgatissima egg laying (F = 0.37, P = 0.95, d.f. = 1) and clutch size (F = 0.00, P = 0.97, d.f. = 1) in the presence of A. nemorum did not differ between the plant sexes . The longevity of A. nemorum in this experiment did not differ between plants of different sexes (t = 0.48, P = 0.63, d.f. = 1). Salix viminalis is a bioenergy crop for which breeding has begun only in the last few decades. Being early in the breeding process, the potential for including traits other than those directly related to growth is high. Knowing that this bioenergy crop suffers substantially from heavy insect damage and insecticide treatment is no option it is important to identify plant genetic material that influences interactions with herbivores and natural enemies in desirable ways. In this study, we investigated how traits of commercial S. viminalis may influence natural herbivore resistance and biological control by evaluating the effects of plant sex on the field abundances and abundances, behavior, performance, and fitness of an insect pest species and an omnivorous insect predator. We found that female S. viminalis plants were preferred over males for oviposition by the main insect pest, P. vulgatissima. This contrasts with previous results for wild S. cinerea (Kabir et al., 2014), where neither plant sex was preferred for oviposition, and indicates that sex-biases are likely plant species-specific. For example, differences between these two Salix species with respect to leaf morphology and/or defences may have caused plant species-dependent patterns in plant sex-biased insect preferences. Although S. viminalis females were preferred for herbivore oviposition in one of the experiments in the present study, we found that insect field abundances and performance-related behavior and traits were unaffected by plant sex. While our results suggest that female S. viminalis plants may be preferred as hosts, there was no plant sex difference in potential number of eggs per plant and beetle. It is possible, however, that undetected oviposition-related effects of sex were present in our experiments. Because herbivore eggs are distributed over clutches that often represent oviposition events, comparing also the numbers of egg clutches between treatments may provide additional information (Stephan et al., 2015) of plant sex preferences. We did not record number of clutches and thus could not analyse effects on number of clutches. Phratora vulgatissima adults may disperse among plants, but their larvae typically remain on their natal host plant. Therefore initial choice of the first adult generation of a year, and oviposition preferences, may be crucial with respect to the subsequent leaf damage caused by larvae. However, abundances were nevertheless similar between field treatments, suggesting that there are no strong effects of plant sex over larger spatial scales. The abundances and predation rates of the predator (A. nemorum) were similar between plants of different sexes, and between fields with different sex ratios. This result indicates that predation rate has not led to P. vulgatissima abundances being balanced between plant sexes or fields with different plant sex ratios. We did not measure the abundances of other potential predators, but we only rarely observed Orthotylus marginalis (KKM, personal observation), another major natural enemy of P. vulgatissima. Given the scale of our field experiment, it is unlikely that any major effects of plant sex on insect abundances would have been missed. However, it is possible that there may have been undetected differences during times where we did not record abundances and higher overall abundances likely would have led to higher detectability. Overall abundances being rather low may also have affected detectability of sex-biases, because P. vulgatissima is an aggregating species. In addition, plant ages differed among our experiments, where field plants were up to four years old and laboratory plants were as young as six weeks at the time of exposure to insects. Herbivory may vary with age or life stage in plants (Avila-Sakar and Romanow, 2012), and it is possible that this introduced variation to our experiments. However, plants with ages spanning across the ages of plants used in our experiments have previously successfully been used to demonstrate genotypic effects on life history traits of P. vulgatissima (Torp et al., 2013) and A. nemorum (Stenberg et al., 2010), suggesting that we captured plant ages that can affect these insects. Our laboratory and field experiments provided mixed evidence for plant sex effects on A. nemorum predators. While survival of A. nemorum was higher on flowering S. viminalis female clones than on males, there was no difference in survival time on bagged plants where P. vulgatissima eggs were available. However the insects in the latter experiment were not all of the same age at its start, which may have introduced variation in survival rate. Our results contrast with the shorter development time found on vegetative S. cinerea male plants compared to female plants (Kabir et al., 2014). Effects of willow sex on A. nemorum could depend on plant species, seasonality plant age and/or host prey. Host prey availability as a modulator of host plant quality is supported by the finding that A. nemorum prefers female plants, despite performing better on vegetative male plants, of S. cinerea (Kabir et al., 2014). Potential differences between S. viminalis and S. cinerea leading to different effects on A. nemorum and P. vulgatissima may include secondary metabolite content, structural defences and evolutionary history. Species-specificity and variation in plant sex effects on herbivory and predation, as discussed above, may be important when considering plant sex effects in other crops, or wild plants. If common denominators for different types of plant sex effects can be identified however, plant sex effects may be better understood and more promising as enhancers of plant protection in dioecious crops. Causal traits in plant sex-biased interactions may include plant sexual dimorphism in chemical or structural defences (Ågren et al., 1999), or nutritional values in plant tissues consumed by the herbivore or potential biological control agents. Our laboratory results should be interpreted with caution, especially in the light of little evidence for differences. The statistical power our laboratory experiments was to some extent sacrificed for the benefit of the broad variety of approaches that we used (Supplementary material 1). Our rationale was to prioritize the number of investigated mechanisms for differences in herbivore and predator performance between S. viminalis sexes over high power for detecting weak effects between sexes. Because our main goal of this study was to detect effects on a broad set of traits with potential relevance to plant breeding, we sought differences with large effect sizes as these have higher practical significance (Kotrlik and Atherton, 2011). Thus, we do not suggest that there is conclusively no difference in herbivory or predation between the sexes of S. viminalis and more extensive studies may have found weak effects that our study missed. However, these weak effects would be unlikely to be useful in an IPM context. Our results suggest that, for the pest and its main natural enemy, plant sex is not a major element in the community genetics of S. viminalis. This contrasts with the findings of our previous studies showing that plant sex is important for a major rust pathogen that attacks Salix Short Rotation Coppices (Moritz et al., 2016). The rate of infection by the rust was significantly higher on female plants, suggesting that farmers should select male cultivars in order to reduce disease incidence. Similarly, we have also shown that a mix of plant sexes increases herbivory by roe deer (Moritz, 2017), implying that plant sex may still be an important component to take into consideration in crop production and management. In addition, reports of sex-biased herbivory in other managed dioecious plants (e.g. Acer negundo, Jing and Coley, 1990) underline the importance of plant sex for trophic interactions and strengthening the case for potential utilization of plant sex in breeding programmes. However, there are also other examples of dioecious plants not experiencing plant sex-biased herbivory, such as Pistacia lentiscus (Hjältén et al., 1993). Other potential candidates for sex biased effects in cultivated plants may for example include poplars (Populus spp.), spinach (Spinacia oleracea), and papaya (Carica papaya). Because the present study shows that plant sex has no important effects on the biocontrol of pest insects in S. viminalis it, however, suggests that female cultivars and plant sex mixes can safely be avoided in order to reduce pathogen attack and roe deer problems, without compromising insect pest management. Rather, our results suggest that a focus on developing plant traits that confer resistance to the herbivore P. vulgatissima and, preferably simultaneously, promote omnivorous predators will be the best IPM strategy. Our finding that field abundances were dependent on plant genotype increases the likelihood of success by providing opportunities to identify particularly suitable plant traits or genotypes.',\n"," \"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent Long-Lived Greenhouse Gas (LLGHG), and involved in the destruction of stratospheric ozone (Ciais et al., 2013). Agricultural soils are an important source of atmospheric N2O, with denitrification representing the single most important biochemical process releasing N2O into the atmosphere (Butterbach-Bahl and Dannenmann, 2011; Harter et al., 2014a, 2014b). Measures for reducing N2O emission from agricultural soils such as biochar addition are increasingly considered to mitigate the impact of agriculture on climate change. A number of factors affecting N2O emission in biochar-amended soils have been investigated, including feedstock, pyrolysis temperature, biochar pre-treatment, soil and biochar pH, soil type and soil moisture regime (Castaldi et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012; Ameloot et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2017). For example, Yanai et al. (2007) suggested that a pH increase resulting from biochar addition could enhance N2O reductase activity, thereby increasing the reduction of N2O to N2in the last step of denitrification. Van Zwieten et al. (2009) hypothesized that metals present on biochar surfaces might act as catalysts in the reduction of N2O to N2. Physical adsorption of N2O and NO on activated coconut charcoal has also been reported (Bagreev et al., 2001; Hitoshi et al., 2002; Cornelissen et al., 2013). Case et al. (2015) found that the suppression of soil N2O emissions was not due to limitations of inorganic N availability in the soil caused by biochar-induced inorganic N immobilization. Furthermore, direct impacts of biochar on the activity of mineralizing and nitrifying microbes (Lehmann et al., 2011) may also occur but have, so far, hardly been investigated. Using the 15N gas-flux method, Cayuela et al. (2013) observed a consistent reduction of the N2O/N2 ratio in 15 different soils after amendment with biochar, and proposed that biochar may act as an “electron shuttle”, facilitating the last step of denitrification (N2O to N2). According to Singh et al. (2010), sorption capacity of biochar through oxidative reactions on the biochar surfaces increase the effectiveness of biochar in reducing nitrate leaching, nitrification and N2O emissions. However, biochar effects on N2O emissions may also be mediated by its impact on prevailing soil conditions (Karhu et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2011; Case et al., 2012) that can influence the gross nitrogen turnover rates such as ammonification, nitrification, and inorganic N immobilization (Clough and Condron, 2010; Karhu et al., 2011). These conditions in turn exert feedbacks on N2O formation and consumption. Knowledge on interactions between biochar addition, gross N turnover rates and soil N2O emissions is limited. Such detailed process-based understanding of N cycling in biochar-amended soils is important, since the ultimate effect of biochar addition on N gaseous losses could also depend on biochar's direct and/or indirect effect on ammonification, nitrification, microbial inorganic N immobilization, since these processes ultimately provide or remove substrate for denitrification and also impact N gas product ratios (Butterbach-Bahl and Dannenmann, 2011, Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2013). Furthermore, understanding biochar effects on gross N turnover is generally desirable to understand biochar effects on key soil functions such as fertility and nutrient retention (Clough and Condron, 2010). So far, the influences of biochar on gross N turnover rates and the N2O:N2 emission ratio, have only been considered separately in these earlier studies (Cayuela et al., 2013; Case et al. 2015). In this study, we provide data collected simultaneously on both the soil microbial gross N transformations as well as N2O and N2 emissions under the influence of biochar amendment and also measure the dynamics of all the soil mineral N pools. The objective of this study therefore was to provide a mechanistic understanding of biochar effects on the interplay of gross soil N mineralization, nitrification and immobilization as well as denitrification and the N2O:N2 product ratio. Three mineralogically contrasting tropical agricultural soils were used. We generally expected a coupling of soil gross N turnover (mainly gross nitrification) and N2O emissions, and that biochar impacts on gross N turnover would thus also affect N2O emissions. Specifically, we hypothesized that biochar addition to soil would (1) decrease nitrification and soil nitrate availability due to increased immobilization of mineral N; (2) decrease soil N2O emissions due to reduced total denitrification. The feedstock from eucalyptus wood was chopped and ground into 5 mm-sized particles and fed into a 600 l batch pyrolysis unit using argon as a sweep gas at a flow rate of one liter per minute. The pyrolysis unit was programmed to run with a ramp temperature rate of 5 °C per min, reaching maximum temperature of 550 °C and a dwell time of 2 h at maximum temperature before cooling to room temperature. Three soil types with contrasting characteristics were sampled (0–0.2 m topsoil) at the following sites in Western Kenya; (i) Gambogi (E34° 57′37″and N00°09′34″an Acrisol under cultivation for ~100 years mainly with maize-beans intercropping hereafter, Acrisol-100), (ii) Kechire (E35°0′00'and N0° 4′0″, an Acrisol after approximately 10 years of conversion from tropical high forest to maize cultivation, Acrisol-10), and (iii) Yala (a Ferralsol also under maize-beans cultivation >100 years, Ferralsol-100). The properties of the biochar and soil at each site are presented in Table 1. All the three soils are characterized by high content of 1:1 type clay presence of highly insoluble minerals such as quartz sand and sesquioxides, and low CEC. The organic matter content (Acrisol 10 > Acrisol 100 > Ferralsol 100Yala) and clay content (Kechire<Gambogi<Yala) were the major distinguishing features among the soils. In addition, the presence of iron and aluminum oxides as well as low amounts of available calcium and magnesium ions characterized the Ferralsol. The experiment consisted of nine treatments that were derived from the three soils (Acrisol 10, Acrisol 100 and Ferralsol) and three biochar addition rates (0, 2% and 4%w/w). The pH of the biochar was adjusted to that of the soil using diluted HCl. The pH of the soil-biochar mixture was monitored and correlation between delta-pH (difference between original and final pH of the soil) was not correlated with N2O emission (Data not shown). Then, air-dry sieved soils (2 mm mesh) were re-wetted to 40% of water holding capacity (WHC) and incubated at 25 °C for seven days before the start of the experiment to stabilize microbial processes. After the stabilization period, each treatment was prepared by adding the appropriate biochar rate to the bulk soil and mixed thoroughly. The incubation was performed in two experiments that were run independently but under identical incubation conditions; Experiment 1 was used for 15N isotope labeling as a basis for the application of the 15N pool dilution technique (as described in more detail by Dannenmann et al., 2010; Dannenmann et al., 2011) to quantify gross N turnover (nitrification, ammonification and NH4+/NO3−consumption/immobilization, three replicates for each treatment) and the associated N2O emissions (six replicates for each treatment). Experiment 2 was deployed using the helium flow soil core method (Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2002; Dannenmann et al., 2008) to simultaneously measure N2O and N2 in order to determine the N2O/N2 ratio in soils which did not receive 15N additions with two replicates for each treatment. Only two analytical replicates were possible due to limited capacities of the Helium soil core system and the long time needed for gas exchange. However, all N2 flux measurements were average fluxes from seven simultaneously incubated soil cores so that spatial replication was comparably good (see below). Gross rates of ammonification, nitrification and inorganic N consumption were determined using the15N pool dilution technique as described in detail by Dannenmann et al. (2010). Briefly, 200 g samples of air-dry soil were placed in 500 cm3 incubation bottles fitted with rubber caps to allow for air tightness during gas sampling. The bottles were prepared in duplicates to allow for separate enrichment with either 15NO3− or 15NH4+. After mixing the wet soil with biochar, the moisture content of the treatments was raised to 70% WHC w/w and maintained at that level throughout the experiment by daily weighing and replacing water lost by evaporation. The incubation bottles were placed in the thermostatically–controlled incubator maintained at 25 °C (the average daily soil temperature in western Kenya) throughout the 20-day experimental period. Before destructive soil sampling, the incubation bottles were closed, gas-tight, using the rubber caps, and 10 ml of gas was sampled at 0, 30, 60 and 90 min after closing. The range of R2 values ranged from 0.75 to 0.99%. However, a flux was included in the analysis only if the R2 was >85%. The gas samples were collected using a 20-ml syringe and injected into pre-evacuated 10-ml gas vials. Analyses of gas samples were done using a gas chromatograph equipped with an Electron Capture Detector (ECD) for N2O analysis as described in detail by Yao et al. (2010). Nitrous oxide flux was calculated from linear changes of N2O concentrations in the headspace (Yao et al., 2010). Immediately after gas sampling, the soils in the bottles were enriched with a solution of either K15NO3or (15NH4)2SO4 at 50 atom% enrichment. The Isotopically labelled solution was applied by spraying it onto the soil, accompanied by intensive mixing (Dannenmann et al., 2010). For each sample, half of the soil was extracted 1 h after enrichment (T0) and the second half was stored in an incubator at 250C for 24 h before the second extraction (T1). Sixty grams of T0 and T1 samples were extracted with 120 ml of 0.5 M potassium sulphate (K2SO4) solution by end-to-end shaking for 60 min. All extracts were filtered through 0.45 μm syringe filters. The diffusion method was used for subsequent trapping NH4+ or NO3− as NH3 on acid traps made of ashless filter paper (Brooks et al. 1989; Dannenmann et al., 2006, 2010). The 14/15N-ratio of the N captured on the dried filter papers was analyzed using an elemental analyzer coupled to a mass spectrometer as described in detail by Guo et al. (2013). Ammonium and nitrate concentrations in extracts were quantified using colorimetric auto-analysis (AQUAfast COD165 Thermoreactor, Thermofisher Scientific, USA) according to the VDLUFA method C 221 (Hoffmann, 1991). Gross rates of ammonification and nitrification were calculated using the equations given by Kirkham and Bartholomew (1954) using T0 and T1 data on N pools and 15N enrichment of ammonium and nitrate, respectively. Furthermore, we calculated gross inorganic NH4+ and NO3− consumption and then estimated immobilization of NH4+ by subtracting nitrification rates from NH4+ consumption rates (Davidson, 1992). We do not declare nitrate consumption to resemble biotic and/or abiotic nitrate consumption because other nitrate fates such as denitrification may be substantial in our incubations. Soil pH was determined using a pH meter after shaking a 1:2.5 w/v soil-to-water mixture and allowing it to stand overnight before measurement. Gas flux analyses and determination of gross N turnover were conducted immediately after biochar addition, and after 3, 7, and 20 days in triplicate. Overall, 216 jars with soil were used for this purpose in this experiment. Emission rates of N2 were determined by use of the helium gas flow soil core method (Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2002) with the modified setup for smaller soil samples and better representation of spatial variability described by Dannenmann et al. (2010). The method is based on the exchange of the soil and headspace atmospheres by a helium‑oxygen atmosphere containing only 25 ppm N2in an extremely gas-tight incubation system and the subsequent simultaneous automated detection of N2 concentration changes in the headspace above the cores by use of a pulse discharge helium ionization detector (PDHID) for N2. The general set-up of the system consists of the steering unit, two vessels containing seven soil cores equipped for automated flushing both through the soil cores and headspace, automated sampling and the detection devices and systems. Details of the system and of the conditions for N2 analysis are described by Dannenmann et al. (2011). The soils were pre-treated as described above and placed in the seven cores (0.01 m3 volume each) of a single incubation vessel (soil moisture 70% WHC w/w incubation temperature: 25 °C). After closing the vessels, the soil cores were flushed for 72 h to quantitatively remove N2 from the soil and headspace atmospheres. Subsequently, an artificial headspace atmosphere was created (5 h of flushing with 80% He, 20% O2, 25 ppm N2, 400 ppb N2O) and finally the concentration change of N2 in the two cuvettes was monitored automatically for 8 h on an hourly basis according to Butterbach-Bahl et al. (2002). Every sample gas analysis was accompanied by six automated calibration gas measurements of the gas chromatographs. For each treatment, two replicates (each consisting of combined N gas measurements from seven soil cores) were used. Before starting the measurement, the air-tightness of the system was checked with a parallel set-up containing empty vessels and soil core dummies made of steel; the inherent leakage rate of N2 was <20 μg N2-N m−2 h−1. Calculation of cumulative fluxes during the incubation period was based on linear interpolation between measurements. All biogeochemical N data were expressed on a soil dry weight (sdw) basis. The main effect of biochar presence, biochar rate or soil type was tested using factorial ANOVA after natural log transformation, and individual means were separated by the methods of Least Significant Difference (LSD) at 95% level of confidence. Correlation analysis was used to assess the relationships between soil properties and N transformation processes and gaseous N products. The cumulative N2O losses over the incubation period followed the order Acrisol10 > Acrisol-100 > Ferralsol (Fig. 1), i.e., decreased with decreasing soil organic carbon content (Table 1). The application of biochar reduced cumulative N2O emission (Fig. 1) by 53 to 78% across soils and biochar addition treatments. Increasing the application rate of biochar from 2% to 4%, however, did not significantly reduce cumulative N2O emissions from any of the three soils (Fig. 1). No significant correlations were found between various mineral concentrations in biochar and N2O emissions (Supplementation Material). Fig. 2 illustrates the dynamics of soil NO3−-N and NH4+-N concentrations during the 20-day incubation period. All three soils showed comparable initial NO3− concentrations of ca 10 mg N kg−1sdw, while initial NH4+-N concentrations strongly differed across soils with the pattern Acrisol10 > Acrisol100 > Ferralsol, with the latter showing extremely low NH4+ concentrations. For Acrisol10and Acrisol100 soils, NH4+ concentrations decreased throughout the incubation, while there was a parallel increase in NO3−concentrations in the same order of magnitude (Fig. 2). In contrast, the Ferralsol showed no pronounced change in soil mineral N concentrations. Towards the end of the incubation, biochar addition had resulted in increased NO3− concentrations in Acrisol 10 but decreased NO3− concentrations in the Acrisol100 (only for the high addition rate) and in the Ferralsol (for both addition rates) (Fig. 2). In contrast, soil NH4+concentrations were significantly reduced by biochar addition, but only for the Acrisol10 soil. For the Acrisol10 and Acrisol100 soils, gross nitrification rates were similar to gross ammonification rates, indicating a nitrate-oriented N cycle. In contrast, the Ferralsol showed gross nitrification rate to be significantly lower than gross ammonification (Fig. 3; Table 2). Overall, a biochar addition rate of 2% increased ammonification rates of Acrisol-10 (69%) and Ferralsol (639%) soils, with a similar effect of the high application rate of 4% (85% increase for Acrisol10 and 282% increase for Ferralsol) over the entire incubation period, while no persistent or unidirectional effect was observed for Acrisol100 (Figs. 3 and 5). With regard to gross nitrification rates, no persistent effects of biochar addition were generally observed over the incubation period (Fig. 3). Despite these variable effects, cumulative gross nitrification rates as calculated over the entire incubation period were significantly increased for all three soils at 4% biochar addition but not at 2% biochar addition (Table 2, Fig. 5). Ammonium immobilization rates as calculated from ammonium consumption minus gross nitrification resulted in significantly negative for the Acrisol 10, indicating N dynamics such as heterotrophic nitrification, i.e., a direct oxidation of organic N to NO3− (Fig. 4). Hence, we did not calculate overall mean NH4+ immobilization fluxes for this soil (Fig. 5). Application of biochar increased NH4+-N immobilization only for the Ferralsol. In contrast, biochar generally increased NO3− consumption for the Acrisol 100, decreased NO3− consumption for the Acrisol100 and had no effect on NO3− consumption in the Ferralsol (Table 2, Figs. 4, 5). For dinitrogen losses, only two measurements are available so that from a statistical perspective we were unable to distinguish across soils and treatments. Dinitrogen emissions generally exceeded N2O emissions by at least an order of magnitude, so that they may represent total denitrification rates very well. Without biochar application, N2 emissions were about an order of magnitude lower for Acrisol10 compared to Acrisol100 and Ferralsol (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Similar to other results on N turnover, biochar tended to exert variable effects on soil N2 emissions (Fig. 5). For the Acrisol-10, a very large increase in N2emissions was observed with increasing biochar addition (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). In contrast, for the Acrisol100, biochar addition did not change N2 emissions. To further complicate the picture, biochar addition decreased N2 emissions from the Ferralsol (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). One important finding of our study was that biochar had a consistent mitigation effect on N2O emission (ca 70% reduction) independent of the soil type and amount of biochar (Fig. 1). It is remarkable that this was observed for all three soils given their different initial N2O emissions, properties and management history. This is generally consistent with earlier studies reporting that biochar reduced net N2O emissions at the soil-atmosphere interface, although the mitigation of N2O emissions in this study was higher than the average effect reported (Case et al., 2012; Saarnio et al., 2013; Cayuela et al., 2013; Cayuela et al., 2015; Hagemann et al., 2017). Some of the proposed mechanisms underlying N2O emission reduction include the reduction of mineral N (NH4+ and NO3−) availability, thus reducing the availability of N substrates for nitrification and denitrification (Singh et al., 2010). This mechanism relates on the one hand to biochar/soil surface/colloidal chemistry (e.g. pH and redox potential). On the other hand, through addition of C, also heterotrophic microbial immobilization could increase after biochar addition, thereby also reducing soil mineral N availability. Furthermore, the different redox-active components of biochar directly affect denitrification and its single steps – e.g., through a promotion of nitrate and N2O reduction via electron donation, a decrease in total denitrification by serving as alternative electron acceptor, or – most universally – by acting as electron shuttle for the nosZ harbouring bacterial community, thereby increasing gross N2O reduction and net N2O exchange at the soil-atmosphere interface (Cayuela et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2017). The latter universal process might dominate in our study in view of the consistent N2O reduction across soils, while biochar effects on soil mineral N availability were inconsistent and multidirectional (Fig. 5). Further or associated mechanisms how biochar impacts N2O reduction in denitrification have been reported and encompass e.g., entrapment in water-saturated soil pores and consequent stimulation of microbial N2O reduction by classical denitrifiers and atypical N2O reducers (Harter et al. 2016). The second important observation of our study is that N2O emission was not directly coupled to dynamics gross microbial N turnover (ammonification, nitrification and microbial N immobilization). This might reflect that denitrification dominates N2O emissions with denitrification and in particular the N2:N2O ratios not directly depending on ammonification and nitrification. A decoupling of denitrification from ammonification and nitrification seems also possible in view of denitrification rates being several orders of magnitude lower than gross soil N turnover, and due to the different environmental and soil biogeochemical controls (Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2013). For soil NH4+ concentrations, there was a persistent and significant trend for reduced concentrations under biochar addition across soils (Fig. 5). However, this did not affect gross nitrification as a potential source process for N2O, which was either increased (Acrisol10 soil) or overall unchanged (Acrisol100 and Ferralsol). The biochar-induced reduction of soil N2O emissions was also uncoupled from biochar effects on gross ammonification, which was either increased (Acrisol10and Ferralsol) or decreased (Acrisol100soil) by biochar (Fig. 5). Consequently, the persistent biochar-induced reduction of N2O emissions across three different agricultural soils, which had contrasting soil properties, gross N turnover and inorganic N availability, is supporting a rather universal mechanism that is acting during gross N2O formation and consumption through denitrification such as the “electron shuttle theory” (Cayuela et al., 2013). Sun et al. (2017) showed that biochars were able to rapidly transport electrons not only via surface functional groups but also through the carbon matrix, increasing electron transport in soils. We have previously shown (Fungo et al., 2014) that steam-activation of biochar increases biochar's capacity to mitigate N2O emission. This suggests that the “electron shuttle” mechanism is facilitated by the surface chemistry of biochar to reduce activation energy required to cause cleavage of the N2O molecule to form N2. In fact, Chen et al. (2017) have shown that redox-active components (dissolved aromatic moieties and condensed aromatic structure) decreased total N denitrified because their dominant quinone moieties and electrical conductivity structure served as alternative electron acceptors. Chen et al. (2017) further observed that the redox-active components of biochar accelerated the last step of denitrification and decreased N2O emission by 74%–99%. In all cases their study showed a significant increase in organic matter-oxidizing and nitrate-reducing bacteria in the nosZ-harbouring bacterial community, which promoted N2O reduction. A promotion of N2O reduction to N2 by biochar should result in increased N2 emissions. The data on N2 emissions available in the current study, however, support this for only the Acrisol 10. This is attributed to the high CEC due to secondary minerals in the Ferralsol compared to the Acrisol. There is needs to note, however, that N2 emissions are usually at least an order of magnitude larger than net N2O exchange at the soil-atmosphere interface (Fig. 5). This means that a small increase in gross N2O consumption due to biochar addition might hardly change the larger N2 emissions in this study (see also Wen et al., 2016). Although the spatiotemporal resolution of our N2 data preclude firm conclusions, the observed patterns tend to support that – independently of biochar effects on N2O reduction – there might be further effects of biochar on total denitrification, which again seems to be variable across the soils under investigation. Though biochar effects on gross N turnover were variable across soils and biochar addition rate, we observed a remarkably strong stimulation of gross ammonification by a factor of 3–6 induced by biochar addition in the Ferralsol and a stimulation of gross nitrification in the Acrisol10 soil by 70% at least under 4% addition. Soil physicochemical properties may affect gross N turnover and availability of N via interaction with the minerals (Kizito et al., 2014), physical entrapment of substrates, diffusion in micro-pores (Fidel et al., 2017), and availability of easily mineralizable organic carbon (Lan et al., 2017). Increased nitrification and ammonification following biochar amendment has also been reported in previous studies. The suggested mechanisms include (i) provision of energy for microorganisms to degrade existing SOM through co-metabolism (Clough and Condron, 2010; Anderson et al., 2011; Nelissen et al., 2012); and (ii) absorbing potential allelochemical inhibitors of microbial metabolic pathways, such as monoterpenes and various polyphenolic compounds that are inhibiting nitrification (Ball et al., 2011). A stimulation of microorganisms might also be based on the micronutrients such as Ca, Mg, Cu and B that are supplied by biochar. In the case of the Ferralsol, with the high clay content, CEC due to dominance of kaolinite and sesquioxides, low C and N contents and low inorganic N availability, the absorption capacity of clay minerals for available OC and NH4+ might explain the very low gross N turnover rates in the 0% biochar control treatment compared to the other two soils. Consequently, biochar addition indeed might have stimulated the microbial community by addition of C substrates, as all heterotrophic processes (ammonification, immobilization, denitrification) responded positively to the biochar treatment (Fig. 5). Our study demonstrates that biochar consistently reduced N2O emission in three different agricultural soils of western Kenya. As this effect was decoupled from biochar effects on gross soil N turnover and inorganic N concentrations, it may have been due to a universal mechanism such as the promotion of N2O reduction within the last step of denitrification, i.e., the “electron shuttle theory”. Biochar effects on gross N turnover were, in contrast to those on N2O emissions, very variable across soils. Despite a large number of analyzed soil parameters, it remained difficult to disentangle the mechanisms of these different biochar effects on gross N turnover, which makes it difficult to predict biochar effects on soil functions related to soil microbial inorganic N production and consumption.\",\n"," 'Over the last two decades, many research projects have sought to generate new analytical sensor devices applying microfluidic sample processing. Despite the diversity of the newly developed test systems only a very small number of devices have made the way to the market in the field of point-of-care (POC) immunoassay systems [1]. For applications in which quantification and high sensitivity are less important, the lateral flow test is still the tool of choice due to its simplicity and low production cost [1]. On the other hand, devices for applications with high demands regarding sensitivity and accurate quantification cannot yet match the performance of laboratory analyzers. pes diagnosesysteme has developed a microfluidic device for POC diagnostics with active fluidics and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) detection. The device consists of a single-use cartridge, which contains all biomaterials, and an instrument, which pneumatically moves the liquid, controls the microfluidic assay steps with the aid of optical sensors and reads the TIRF assay. The responsIQ is to our knowledge the only POC system that controls the fluidic action by optical sensors, which detect the position of the sample within the cartridge. These optical sensors also control the sample volume, which is loaded on the cartridge by means of a 50 µL positive displacement pipette. As proof of concept, a BNP test has been installed on the system. BNP is a clinical marker for the diagnosis of heart failure and for risk assessment in cases of acute coronary syndrome. As BNP is present in human plasma only in low pg/mL up to low ng/mL levels, a highly sensitive test is required. The use of a typical cut-off concentration in clinical practice of 100 pg/mL for patients presenting with acute onset or worsening of symptoms or alternatively of 35 pg/mL for patients with non-acute presentations [2] requires a quantitative assay with high precision at the decision cut-offs. The objective of this study was to show that the BNP test fulfils the basic requirements regarding analytical performance, storage stability of its cartridges and correlation to reference systems to be used as POC test. Therefore, determination of detection limit and imprecision, a study on cartridge storage stability and a comparison to reference systems using patient samples were performed. A pair of commercially available sandwich murine anti-BNP monoclonal antibodies (mAb) was used for BNP detection. The anti-BNP clone 50E1 from Hytest Ltd (Turku, Finland) was used as capture antibody. The anti-BNP clone 24C5, also from Hytest Ltd, was used as detection antibody. The activated cyanine dye S 0458 (CAS-No 661465-58-3) was purchased from FEW Chemicals GmbH (Bitterfeld-Wolfen, Germany). Glycosylated proBNP was obtained from Hytest Ltd. Dry bags Minipax and Alu-PE pouches were ordered from Ströbel (Langenzenn, Germany). Gilson Microman pipettes with fixed volume of 50 µL (custom-made adaption) and tips were made by Gilson S.A.S. (Villiers-le-Bel, France). RFID tags MiniTrack Paper Tag 3002077 were ordered from Smarttrac Technology Group (Frankfurt am Main, Germany). All other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Munich, Germany). EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood from patients was received from a local cardiologist. These specimens were left over from routine checkups of the patients and all samples were anonymised. EDTA plasma was generated by centrifugation of whole blood samples at 2830 g for 10 min and collection of the supernatant. responsIQ is a new POC immunoassay platform and comprises a readout instrument and ready-to-use cartridges (Fig. 1A). The platform requires 50 µL of sample (either whole blood or plasma). Measurement is performed in less than 10 min. Several safety features, such as integrated control of sample volume and flow as well as storage of calibration and lot specific data on each cartridge, are applied. responsIQ measures the rate of increase of the fluorescence signal, which is proportional to the concentration of analyte in solution. The resulting signal slope in V/s is read off the calibration curve by the analysis software and the BNP result is displayed on the instrument׳s screen. Further background information on the responsIQ has been published in a patent application [3]. The measurement principle of the responsIQ has already been described by Rascher et al. [4], who have developed a procalcitonin assay on the system (Video A1). The single-use cartridge contains a micro-fluidic system with an optical area for detection (Fig. 1B). The integrated assay reagents consist of a BNP sandwich assay. Within the measuring cell, three lines of BNP capture antibody are immobilized. The anti-BNP detection antibody was labeled in-house with the activated cyanine dye S 0458 (λex,max=647 nm/λem,max=664 nm, 2–3.5 mol dye per mol antibody) to form the BNP detection conjugate (detection antibody). The detection solution contains the detection antibody as well as buffer components and blocking components. The detection solution is dispensed into the detection antibody zone (Fig. 1B). All assay reagents are dried into the channels for stability reasons. An integrated RFID-tag stores test- and lot-specific data. The cartridge is packaged in Alu-PE pouch with a silica gel pack. A low endogenous EDTA plasma pool was generated by selecting and mixing samples with BNP concentration less than 15 pg/mL. The BNP concentration of the pool was measured on a Siemens ADVIA Centaur® (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Erlangen, Germany) and the pool was stored at −80 °C in aliquots. Glycosylated proBNP, which is the prohormone of BNP and comprises the BNP peptide chain, was used for calibration, as it is considerably more stable towards degradation in plasma matrices than BNP [5]. Also, glycosylated proBNP has been shown to be the major component of immunodiagnostically detected BNP in patients with heart failure [6]. The manufacturer of the glycosylated proBNP (Hytest Ltd) determines the antigen mass of glycosylated proBNP with respect to the peptide content of the molecule (M=11905.5 g/mol). The BNP molecule has a lower molecular weight of 3464 g/mol. The concentration of a calibrator (in pg/mL) is labeled with respect to the BNP fraction of the calibrator, termed ‘BNP equivalent’ in this work, and translates to a 3.44 times higher mass of contained glycosylated proBNP. For calibration of a new cartridge lot, the following concentrations were spiked into a low endogenous EDTA plasma pool and each calibrator was measured 3 times (see also Section 3.1): for low concentration calibration curve: 0, 70, 150, 270, 400 pg/mL BNP equivalents and for high concentration calibration curve: 700, 1300, 1900, 2500 pg/mL BNP equivalents. The calibration curves were generated by least squares fit. The intersection of both curves was calculated and used as the switch point for the domain of calibration (Fig. 2). The calibration data was written to the RFID chips of the remaining cartridges of the production lot. Afterwards the cartridges were packaged into Alu-PE pouches containing dry packs. 50 µL of sample (either EDTA whole blood or EDTA plasma) was loaded on the sample port of the cartridge by a Gilson Microman pipette. The cartridge lid was closed and the cartridge inserted into the responsIQ instrument. The cartridge was automatically processed by the instrument and the used cartridge ejected automatically after measurement. The BNP result was displayed on the instrument׳s screen and could be printed on the integrated printer. The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated by dividing two standard deviations of the low endogenous plasma pool measurements by the slope of the dose-response curve. The statistical significance of differences between two groups was evaluated using Student׳s unpaired t-test. Values of p<0.05 were considered significant. For method comparison, Passing & Bablok fit was used. Correlation coefficients were calculated using least squares fit. The reportable range of the responsIQ BNP test was 5–2500 pg/mL BNP. The BNP signal rises steadily with concentration in this range, but the slope of the dose-response curve is lower at the low concentration levels. To account for this non-linear behavior, two split linear regressions, one for the low concentration range and one for the high concentration range, were fitted to the respective data (Fig. 2). The slope of the linear regression for the low concentration range was typically 25% lower than the slope of the regression line for the high concentration range. Linearity within each calibration domain was good with high correlation coefficients. The quality of the calibration curve at low concentrations is especially important as the diagnostic decision values are located in this domain. In order to analytically validate and characterize the responsIQ BNP test, the LOD and the within-run coefficient of variation (within-run CV) were determined in ten separate runs over a period of about one year. Each run consisted of ten determinations of low endogenous BNP plasma pool (BNP concentrations from 3.5 to 7.8 pg/mL BNP as determined on ADVIA Centaur) as well as five determinations of each calibrator with 30 pg/mL, 60 pg/mL and 90 pg/mL BNP equivalents spiked into the respective low endogenous BNP plasma pool. Nine different cartridge lots and five different instruments were included in this experiment as indicated in Table 1. The resulting LODs and within-run CVs are shown in Table 1. The data show that the responsIQ BNP test is sufficiently sensitive for the use as clinical BNP test. The LOD is very low for a POC system and is comparable to the sensitivity of laboratory analyzer BNP tests [7,8]. A constructional difference of the responsIQ cartridge compared to most POC devices might explain its high sensitivity for analytes that tend to adsorb to surfaces. The responsIQ cartridge contains no porous materials or membranes, which would display a high surface area to the sample. Most POC devices contain such high-surface-area elements, which can potentially lead to adsorption of analyte molecules to this surface and as a consequence to reduced sensitivity. Highly charged proteins, such as BNP or Troponin I, tend to adsorb to surfaces [9]. BNP has an isoelectric point of 10.95 [10] and Troponin I an isoelectric point of 9.9 [11], which leads to highly charged species of these two analytes at neutral pH. The shelf life of the cartridge unit at 4–7 °C was assessed. A cartridge lot was produced and stored at 4–7 °C. Cartridges were tested with goat serum containing 1000 pg/mL BNP equivalents on the first day following production as well as on subsequent measurement days up to 50 weeks following production using the same instrument throughout the complete study. The data is displayed in Fig. 3. It shows that even after 50 weeks of storage at 4–7 °C no significant reduction of the BNP signal could be observed. Thus, a cartridge shelf life of 50 weeks or greater could be demonstrated. For accelerated temperature testing, cartridges were stored at 37 °C for 3 weeks starting one week following production. Cartridges were measured with goat serum containing 1000 pg/mL BNP equivalents (data not shown). For comparison, cartridges from the same lot, which were stored for the entire period at 4 °C, were measured in the same way. There was no significant change in the assay signal when both storage groups were compared (signal difference: 1%, each group N=6, p=0.744). Thus the cartridges can be considered to be stable at 37 °C for at least 3 weeks. A comparison to reference systems using patient samples was carried out. The goal was to determine the correlation of responsIQ whole blood measurements with an established POC device (Alere Triage® BNP, Alere Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) as well as with an established laboratory analyzer device (Siemens ADVIA Centaur® BNP, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). One responsIQ instrument was installed at a local cardiologist׳s office. There, leftover EDTA/whole blood samples were measured on the responsIQ BNP test (single determination) on-site by nurses in parallel to the routine Triage BNP test. In total, 100 patient samples were analyzed over a period of about 8 weeks without any pre-selection of the samples. The hematocrit of all samples was determined (mean value: 41%, range: 22–51%). Comparison of responsIQ BNP values to Triage BNP is displayed in Fig. 4A. The analyzers show good overall correlation (r=0.972). The slope of 1.06 shows that, on average, both systems give comparable results. For comparison to the laboratory analyzer ADVIA Centaur BNP the 100 samples described above were transferred to the laboratory of pes diagnosesysteme one to five hours after blood draw. Within the following hour, whole blood samples and plasma samples were measured in duplicate on the responsIQ. The remaining plasma was frozen at −80 °C immediately afterwards and sent to a clinical lab for measurement on the Centaur BNP test later. The reason for the second determination of the whole blood samples on the responsIQ for comparison to Centaur BNP was the low storage stability of BNP in whole blood samples at room temperature. Two samples were excluded from Centaur measurement because these had not been stored as specified. Comparison of responsIQ BNP whole blood measurements with the laboratory analyzer test Centaur BNP is displayed in Fig. 4B. Again, a strong correlation can be observed with r=0.974. The slope of 1.29 indicates that results determined by the responsIQ are typically higher than the Centaur BNP results. The intercept of the regression line is negligible. The results show that the responsIQ BNP measurements from whole blood correlate to both reference devices used in this study. From Fig. 4 it can be seen, that responsIQ BNP values show less variation from the regression line when correlated to the lab analyzer ADVIA Centaur BNP than to Alere Triage BNP. The tighter correlation to the Centaur BNP might be in part due to similar epitopes of the antibody pairs used in Centaur BNP and responsIQ BNP assays as well as the duplicate measurement which was carried out on the responsIQ in this comparison. The results from whole blood and plasma both measured on the responsIQ were also compared (data not shown) and show high correlation (r=0.998). The Passing and Bablok fit resulted in a slope of 0.89 and an intercept of 5.44 pg/mL BNP. Thus, whole blood result values were on average 11% lower than the related plasma results. In this study, the performance parameters limit of detection, imprecision, storage stability of cartridges and correlation to reference systems were characterized. It was shown that the responsIQ is a suitable device for the quantitative analysis of BNP from clinical samples. Also, the basic requirements for cartridge storage stability could be met. The sensitivity was in the performance range of laboratory analyzer tests. In conjunction with the safety features installed on the system, the responsIQ could help make POC analysis safer. This is the first extensive validation of an assay on the responsIQ system.

Given that bread constitutes a staple food worldwide, supplementing bread with dietary fiber will contribute to more consumption of dietary fiber. Wheat bran is a by-product of wheat flour production, which is generally discarded or used as animal feed (Hemery et al., 2007). However, wheat bran is rich in dietary fiber, which gives it a valorization potential for applications in fiber-fortified food. The main dietary fiber component in wheat bran is arabinoxylan (AX), which is a hemicellulose with a xylose backbone and arabinose side chains (Goesaert et al., 2005). Therefore, enriching AX in wheat bran for applications in fiber-fortified bread can add value to wheat bran. Conventionally, a wet alkaline process is used to purify AX from wheat bran (see Fig. 1). This process requires large amounts of water and consequently energy for dehydration, and results in significant waste production (Schutyser and van der Goot, 2011). Besides, the harsh alkaline conditions may cause loss of functional groups of the AX (e.g., phenolic acids esterified to the arabinose residues of AX) (Zhou et al., 2010). Alternatively, a dry fractionation process has been proposed to extract AX-enriched fractions (AXF) from wheat bran (see Fig. 1) (Wang et al., 2015a,b), which consumes little energy and retains the native functionality of wheat bran components. As the key step of the dry fractionation process, electrostatic separation of wheat bran particles is based on their histological characteristics and tribo-electric charging behavior, i.e. particles from the AX-rich pericarp tend to be charged oppositely from the particles from aleurone layer and endosperm (Hemery et al., 2011). In brief, milled wheat bran particles pass through a tube by entrainment in a gas (N2), during which the particles are charged by collisions with the wall material of the tube and/or inter-particle contact; and oppositely-charged particles are subsequently separated in an electric field (Wang et al., 2015a,b). A sieving step after electrostatic separation could further improve the purity of the AXF. AX-enriched fractions with an AX content of 43% dry basis is achieved by dry fractionation (Wang et al., 2015a,b). However, in the latter study the yield of the AXF was relatively low (8%) due to the large loss caused by the horizontal design of the electrostatic separator. Hence, a vertical set-up is employed in this study and a higher yield of the AXF is expected (see Supplementary results, Fig. A1). Another important aspect of this study is the AX-fortification of bread. In some studies, the addition of AX or wheat bran has been found to detrimentally influence the structural and organoleptic properties of bread (see Supplementary results, Table A1). This is because AX interferes with the development of the gluten network. As a result, the dough becomes more viscous and less elastic, and ultimately the gas retention and leavening potential are reduced (Gomes et al., 2018). However, it is noteworthy that the effects of wheat AX or wheat bran fortification on the bread quality may not always be detrimental. The results could be influenced by the molecular weight (MW) of the AX, the fortification level and the (enzymatic) pretreatment applied on the AX (or wheat bran) before the baking experiment, etc. For example, fortification of purified AX with high MW (∼1% fortification level) improved the loaf volume of breads. Breads containing high-MW arabinoxylans retained more water and the breadcrumbs were softer during storage than bread fortified with low-MW AX (Biliaderis et al., 1995). In addition, enzymes such as xylanase are often proposed to mitigate the negative effects of AX and to improve the bread quality (Messia et al., 2016). Although AX-fortification of bread has been intensively investigated in the past, the usage of dry-fractionated AXF for applications in fortified bread has received very little attention. Therefore, this study aims at i) investigating the dry fractionation process to extract arabinoxylans-enriched fractions (AXF) from wheat bran, and ii) systematically evaluating the bread baking performance of the dry-fractionated AXF. In this context, a vertically designed electrostatic separator set up is employed for the dry fractionation experiment. Subsequently, the effects of a modified bread recipe and pre-treatment of AXF using xylanase on the quality attributes of fortified bread is investigated. The results reported here may bring new insights into the AX-fortification of bread employing dry-fractionated wheat bran as a high-value food ingredient. Two batches of wheat bran for the dry fractionation experiment were purchased from Koopmans Meel BV (batch #1, Leeuwarden, the Netherlands) and Windkorenmolen De Vlijt (batch #2, Wageningen, the Netherlands), respectively, with the following specifications: batch #1, dietary fibre 44% (w/w), moisture 15% (w/w), protein 15% (w/w), starch 13% (w/w), ash 7% (w/w) and fat 6% (w/w); batch #2, dietary fibre 40% (w/w), moisture 15% (w/w), protein 16% (w/w), starch 12% (w/w), ash 9% (w/w) and fat 8% (w/w). Chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and supplied by Sigma Aldrich (Germany). Wheat flour, UHT skim milk, instant yeast, salt, sugar and unsalted butter were obtained from the local market. Milli-Q water (Merck Millipore, U.S.A.) was used during chemical analysis. Endo-1,4-β-xylanase from rumen microorganism (E-XYRU6) and a total dietary fiber assay kit (K-TDFR-100 A) were purchased from Megazyme (Bray, Ireland). A vitraPOR sintered glass filter with a pore size of 40–100 μm (Robu glas, Hattert, Germany) was used for the analysis of total dietary fiber. The dry fractionation of an arabinoxylan-enriched fraction (hereafter referred to as AXF) from wheat bran consists of three steps: milling, electrostatic separation (ES) and air jet sieving. The wheat bran was first milled using a pin mill (Type 100 UPZ, Hosokawa Alpine, Germany) at a speed of 20 500 rpm, a UPZ power of 1000 W and an air flow of 75 m3/h. To obtain the starting wheat bran flour for the electrostatic separation, four- and five-fold consecutive impact milling steps were carried out for the wheat bran batch #1 and batch #2 (see Section 2.1), respectively. After milling, electrostatic separation of wheat bran flour was performed using a custom-built vertical bench-scale electrostatic separator. A detailed description of this equipment can be found in Wang et al. (2015a) and a schematic drawing of the equipment is provided in the Supplementary results (see Fig. A1). The electrostatic separator consists of four parts: the feeding system, the aluminum charging slit (width × thickness × length: 3  mm × 2.5 mm × 220 mm), the separation chamber with electrode plates (size: 120 mm × 370 mm) and the collection chamber. Wheat bran flour was dosed to the system at a dosing rate of 1.25 kg/h, and the flow rate of the carrier gas (N2) was set at 30 L/min. The electric field strength was set to 200 kV/m, by applying a voltage of 20 kV to the positive electrode: the distance between the electrodes was 10 cm. For wheat bran batch #1, the fraction rich in AX was collected from the positive electrode using a brush (Wang et al., 2015b). For batch #2, two conveyor belts were equipped to continuously remove fractions from the electrodes. Those fractions rich in AX were used as the starting materials for sieving. The fraction rich in AX was sieved using a 50 μm air jet sieve (ALPINE Air Jet Sieve e200 LS, Hosowaka Alpine, Germany) for 2 min at 3000 Pa. After sieving, a coarse fraction and a fine fraction were obtained. The coarse fraction was the AX-enriched fraction (AXF) used in the baking experiment. Depending on the starting wheat bran flour used, two batches of AXF were obtained which are hereafter referred to as AXF-I (fractionated from wheat bran batch #1) and AXF-II (fractionated from wheat bran batch #2). The AX content of different fractions was measured using a modified phloroglucinol method. The method is precisely described in Wang et al. (2015b), and yields the amount of pentosans, including both arabinoxylans and arabinogalactans. Arabinogalactans are present in low levels (0.27–0.38% of dm), and do not interfere with the determination of the AX content. Particle size distributions of the different fractions were measured using a Mastersizer 2000 combined with a Scirocco 2000 dry dispersion unit (Malvern Instruments, UK). The air pressure was 2 bar and the feeding rate was 50% during the measurement. The particle volume size distribution is presented with a logarithmic particle size scale. The measurement for each fraction was done in duplicate. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the fractions were recorded using a Phenom G2 pure Scanning Electron Microscope (Phenom-World BV, Eindhoven, the Netherlands) at a voltage of 5 kV. Two sets of baking experiments were conducted with AXF-I and AXF-II, respectively. For the first set, a bread recipe modified from our previous study was used (Zhang et al., 2016), and 2%, 5% or 10% of wheat flour was replaced by AXF-I in that recipe (see Table 1). For the second set, the amount of water in the recipe was adjusted according to the results of the Farinograph test. A replacement level of 10% AXF-II was used. The aim of the second set of baking experiments was to verify the effect of xylanase on the quality of bread. Therefore, 10 g of AXF-II with or without xylanase were added into 66 mL water, and the mixture was incubated at 40 ○C for 16 h before adding to the dough. The dough was made in a mixer (Bosch, Germany) and divided into small pieces (5 g) which were then shaped into balls. Subsequently, the dough was proofed at 40 ○C, 85% RH for 45 min in a climate chamber (Memmert, Germany). The bread was baked in a preheated convection oven (Heraeus, Germany) at 205 ○C for 8 min (Experiment set 1), and at 235 ○C for 8 min (Experiment set 2). The total moisture content of the baked bread was measured using AOAC method 925.10, by weighing 2 g of sample and dehydrating it at 105 ○C in an oven for 24 h. Texture profile analyses (TPA) of the bread crumb were made using a texture analyzer (Instron, Belgium) equipped with a 2.5 cm cylindrical probe. Crumb samples (2 cm × 2 cm or 1 cm × 1 cm) were 50% compressed at a speed of 1 mm/s in a TPA double compression test, to imitate chewing actions. The delay time between the first and the second compression was 30 s. The parameters obtained were hardness, chewiness, cohesiveness and springiness. Bread samples were scanned using laser topography and the volume was analyzed using VolCalc Software (Perten instruments, Sweden). The specific volume (cm3/g) of the bread samples was expressed as the volume (cm3) divided by the weight (g). The cellular structure of the bread was assessed by a C-Cell imaging system (Calibre Control International Ltd., UK). Briefly, images of the transection of bread sample were taken, and parameters such as cell volume, cell wall thickness and porosity were calculated by pixel analysis using the image analysis software of the system. The bread samples were dried overnight at 70 ○C in a vacuum oven and grinded in a porcelain mortar to reduce the particle size. Subsequently, the AX content and TDF content of the sample were determined using the methods that were described in Section 2.3. All data were presented as mean values of duplicates except where noted, and error bars represent standard deviation (±SD). The student t-test was used to compare means and the p-value was calculated using the T.TEST function in Excel (Microsoft®, USA). A p-value smaller than 0.05 meant that the difference between two means was significant. The particles from the aleurone layer and the endosperm of the wheat grain take positive charge during tribo-electrostatic charging while particles from the pericarp which are rich in AX take negative charge (Wang et al., 2015b). Therefore, the AX enriched fraction (AXF) was negatively charged and collected from the positive electrode during electrostatic separation (ES), i.e., (−) charged fractions (in Table 2). The separation efficiency (SE) of AX by a single electrostatic separation step was 30.6% when a vertical design electrostatic separator was used. This value was higher than the SE of 16% was obtained with a horizontal system design, as was used by Wang et al. (2015b). Overall, the ES and sieving processes enriched the AX from wheat bran flour with a total SE of 14.9%–16.2% in this study. A negative aspect of the employed AX enrichment procedure is the relatively low yield (5.4%–12.5%). The yield of the negatively-charged fractions during ES (13.3%–16.7%) was not improved much by using a vertical separator: Wang et al. (2015b) found a yield of 14% using a horizontal design. The equipped conveyor belts slightly increased the yield of the negatively-charged fractions collected from the electrode (see Section 2.2 & Table 2). The sieving step after ES enriched the AX from the negative-charged fraction (AX content, 38.5%–44.2% of dm) to the final AXF (AX content, 55.8% of dm in AXF-I and 39.2% of dm in AXF-II) by removing starch and protein. The single sieving step had a high separation efficiency of 51.4% for batch #1 and 72.7% for batch #2, respectively. However, this increase of purity of AX was at the expense of the yield. In this study, we opted to incorporate the fractions with the highest AX purity (and low yield) in the breads, therefore the final AXF was used for the subsequent baking experiments. The unused fractions after ES (equal to the sum of the fractions in the collector bags and collected from the negative electrode) had an average AX content of 17.0% for batch #1 and 32.6% for batch #2. These values were close to those of the starting wheat bran flours, i.e., 18.6% for batch #1 and 32.8% for batch #2. Given the high yield of the unused fractions (80.6%–81.2%), recycling of those fractions may well improve the yield of the final AXF and subsequently the overall SE of the dry fractionation procedure (Wang et al., 2016). The functional properties of the AXF were characterized in terms of AX content, TDF content, particle size distribution, color, histological structure and water holding capacity. These properties of the AXF may influence their bread baking performance. The total dietary fiber (TDF) content in AXF-I was 59.6% of the dry matter, which indicates that most dietary fibers in AXF-I were arabinoxylans (AX content 55.8%, see Table 2). However, the TDF content in AXF-II was 59.2% of dm while its AX content was 39.2%, which is probably due to the presence of other dietary fibers in AXF-II (Lu et al., 2000). The dry fractionation procedure increased the total dietary fiber content from around 44% (Fardet, 2010) in the wheat bran to around 59% in the AXF. The particle size distribution analysis of the fractions yield the volume weighted means (D[4,3]) of the wheat bran flour (WFB), the AXF and the fine fraction as 109 μm, 136 μm and 35 μm, for batch #1 (Fig. 2a) and as 272 μm, 246 μm, and 30 μm for batch #2 (Fig. 2b), respectively. In this study, the yield of negatively-charged fractions via ES in batch #1 (13.3% in Table 2) was lower than that of batch #2 (16.7%). This could be possibly attributed to the larger particle size of the WBF for batch #2 than of batch #1. As reported by Wang et al. (2015a,b), the yield of negatively-charged fractions decreased when the particle size of the starting WBF was reduced to 110 μm by cryogenic milling. This may be because the coulombic and other interactions between the oppositely charged particles are more pronounced for smaller particles, resulting in an increase in the formation of agglomerates in the charging tube. These agglomerates are most likely to end up in the positive fraction, compromising the yield of the negatively-charged fractions. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2, the AXF had a brown color due to the pigments naturally present in wheat bran (Žilić et al., 2012). The brown color of the AXF was darker than the WBF and the fine fraction obtained after air jet sieving. This is probably because the sieving step removed starch and protein which are lighter in color. The histological structure (or microstructure) of difference fractions was inspected using SEM imaging. Fig. 2 indicates that the AXF mainly contained particles from the (outer) pericarp (Fig. 2d), while the fine fraction obtained after sieving contained intact starch granules and some small fragments of the pericarp (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, the water holding capacity (WHC) of AXF-I and AXF-II was found to be 3.20 mL/g and 3.37 mL/g, respectively, which was much higher than that of the wheat flour (0.76 mL/g). The high WHC of AX-enriched fractions can be explained by two mechanisms: 1) water is strongly bound through hydrogen bridge or/and in nanopores; 2) water is weakly bound in intact micropores and due to stacking phenomena. Specifically, the particles in the dry-fractionated AXF contains pores (see Fig. 2d) which may be ranging from a micrometer to nanometer scale. These pores probably played an important role in water holding/binding due to enclosure of water through the capillary forces (Jacobs et al., 2015). Other than water bound due to the porous structure, hydrogen bonding of the water molecules to OH-groups on the polymer chain of AX can also contribute to the increased WHC on a molecular lever (Koegelenberg and Chimphango, 2017). The high WHC of AXF is expected to influence the quality of AX-fortified bread. Two sets of bread baking experiments were carried out. In the first set, bread was made by using a standard recipe with different levels of AXF supplementation; in the second set, the amount of water in the recipe was adjusted based on Farinograph analysis. The quality attributes of the AX-fortified breads were evaluated in terms of moisture content, specific volume, crust color, textural properties, crumb cellular structure and nutritional value. In addition, the effect of xylanase on bread quality was investigated. Bread fortified with 10% AXF-I retained significantly (p < 0.05) more water after baking than the Control I group (Table 3), which is in agreement with the results of some other studies (Messia et al., 2016). This might be explained by the higher WHC of AXF, especially the water-unextractable form which has a much higher WHC (9.9 g water/g WUAX) than the water-extractable form (6.3 g water/g WEAX) (Courtin and Delcour, 2002). In contrast, addition of 5% AXF-I showed only a slight decrease (p < 0.05) in the moisture content of the baked bread, which is difficult to explain at this stage. The Farinograph water absorption of the 10% AXF-II dough was 17% higher than with the Control II dough, which can be explained by the higher WHC of AXF compared to wheat flour. The addition of extra water in the recipe for 10% AXF-II and 10% MAXF groups (see Table 1) resulted in a higher moisture content in the dough. However, the moisture content of the baked bread in the set 2 of the experiment did not show significant difference among groups (p > 0.05, Table 3). This indicates that the pre-treatment of AXF using xylanase has no effect on the moisture content of the baked bread compared to the 10% AXF-II group. The texture of the crumb is one of the most important quality indicators of bread. Texture profile analysis (TPA) is used to imitate the chewing action of the teeth, and textural properties (hardness, chewiness, cohesiveness, elasticity) are determined (Bourne, 2002). Table 3 shows the impact of AXF addition on the textural properties of the crumb. The change in crumb hardness (defined as the force required to compress the crumb) was not significant (p 0.05) with supplementation with AXF-I up to 5%. However, the crumb hardness of bread with 10% AXF-I replacement was the highest (p < 0.05). This is most likely explained by the interaction between AX and gluten forming a composite hydrated film network, and the increased water absorption of AX in the dough leaving less water for the other components, which affects the texture of the breadcrumb (Biliaderis et al., 1995). In addition, the water-unextractable arabinoxylans (WUAX) in the AXF have high water absorption, which can lower the stability of the dough foam and eventually reduce the loaf volume and increase the density of the bread matrix. Consequently, the crumb hardness of the fortified bread (10% AXF-I) increased because of its higher density (Curti et al., 2013). Interestingly, the crumb hardness of bread with 10% AXF-II and 10% MAXF replacement became comparable to the control bread (Control II) due to the increased amount of water in the recipe, which supports the hypothesis that water availability here reduces the crumb hardness. A significant decrease of chewiness (defined as the energy required to masticate solid foods) was observed with 5% AXF-I replacement. The chewiness of 10% AXF-I replacement was comparable to that of the Control I group, but significantly higher than that of the 5% AXF-I bread. This is probably due to the change in the cellular structure of the crumb matrix with increasing of AXF-I concentration in bread. In addition, the cohesiveness and elasticity (or springiness) of bread crumb were negatively related to the level of AXF-I replacement. The cohesiveness is the ratio of the positive force area during the second compression to that during the first compression, which we expect to be inversely proportional to the rate at which the material fractures under compression (Rubel et al., 2015). The elasticity indicates how well the crumb recovers after a deformation by compression. The decreased cohesiveness and elasticity of AXF fortified bread indicate the detrimental influence of added AXF-I on bread quality (Heiniö et al., 2016). However, the chewiness, cohesiveness and elasticity of bread fortified with AXF-II were comparable to the Control II bread. Thus, the negative effects of AX on the textural properties of bread are eliminated by the modification of the recipe and/or pre-treatment of AXF-II. As mentioned above, the AX-enriched fraction was darker in color than wheat flour. Therefore, the addition of different levels of AXF-I results in fortified bread with different colors (Fig. 3a). The change in bread color was only noticeable for an AXF-I replacement larger than 5%. As shown in Table 3, under the baking condition in Experiment set 1 (205 ○C, 8 min), the color difference ΔE between the control group and the fortified bread was linearly correlated to the level of AXF-I supplement (R2 = 0.98). The brightness (L*) of the bread crust was negatively correlated to the level of AXF-I addition, while the other two parameters (a* and b*) increased with the increase of AXF-I concentration. The 10% AXF-II replacement resulted in a darker crust color compared to the Control II group as well (see Experiment set 2, Table 3). However, the difference in color of the baked bread fortified with 10% AXF-II and 10% MAXF was not significant (Fig. 3b & Table 3), indicating that xylanase did not affect the color of the AXF-II. Physical properties of bread that are related to crumb structure are cell wall thickness and porosity. Table 3 (Experiment set 1) shows that addition of the AXF-I up to 10% led to larger porosity (p < 0.05) and a coarser, more irregular cellular structure of the fortified bread (Fig. 3a). This coarseness of the crumb was probably caused by the high water retention of AX, which limits the amount of water available to participate in gluten formation in the bread dough, resulting in a poor gluten network (Li et al., 2012). WUAX is known for its negative effect on bread crumb structure, as it destabilizes gas cells by forming a physical barrier or inducing coalescence by disrupting the cell wall film (Courtin and Delcour, 2002; Kiszonas, 2013). Although a volume decrease was expected, a slight increase in the specific volume was observed when the wheat flour was replaced with AXF-I up to a level of 5% (Experiment set 1, Table 3). A larger addition (10% AXF-I) did give a significant decrease in the specific volume. A similar observation was reported by Biliaderis et al. (1995): the initial increase in the volume is probably due to the increased strength and elasticity of the gluten-starch composite network, and the consequent decrease in volume is caused by the increased viscosity, imbalanced viscoelasticity and poor gas retention by the dough system with further addition of arabinoxylans. The difference in the average cell wall thickness among different groups in Experiment set 1 was not statistically significant (p > 0.05, Table 3), indicating a similar homogeneity of the crumb cellular structure among groups (Fig. 3a) (Della Valle et al., 2014). Interestingly, the addition of extra water in the recipe significantly increased the specific volume of 10% AXF-II group compared to the Control II bread (Experiment set 2, Table 3). The cell wall thickness and porosity of the bread was not influenced upon 10% AXF-II replacement (Table 3 & Fig. 3b). Similar results were observed for the xylanase-treated group (10% MAXF). However, neither the specific volume of bread nor the cellular structure of crumb was significantly altered by the application of xylanase. As discussed above, the pre-treatment using xylanase did not significantly improve in the baking performance of AXF compared to the modification of the recipe. In fact, an increase in slackness and stickiness of dough was observed when xylanase-pre-treated AXF (MAXF) was added (see Figure A2 in Supplementary results). This is probably because xylanase solubilized WUAX and reduced its WHC, thus the re-distribution of water over other flour components such as gluten resulted in an increased extensibility of dough (Courtin and Delcour, 2002). It is worth noting that the xylanase concentration used during pre-treatment was fixed at 210 U/g in this study (Table 1), which might not be optimal. The dough handling quality might be improved by either lowering the concentration of xylanase or lowering the water content of the dough (Courtin et al., 2001). This leaves room for further investigation. As expected, both the AX content and TDF content of the bread fortified with 10% AXF-II and 10% MAXF were found significantly higher than the Control II bread (p < 0.05, Table 3). The fortified breads have improved nutritional value, and may be classified as having “high fiber content” (>6 g DF per 100 g product) according to EC Regulation No. 1924/2006 (Messia et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the TDF content of bread fortified with 10% MAXF was lower than that of the 10% AXF-II bread, even though the AX content was similar. This indicates that other hemicelluloses such as fructans and galactans were hydrolyzed by the xylanase rather than AX during the pre-treatment of the AXF-II (Onipe et al., 2015). The combination of milling with electrostatic separation and sieving was used to prepare AX-enriched fractions with an AX content of 39.2–55.8% dry basis. The AXF were incorporated in wheat bread to fortify the breads with fiber. AX-fortification of bread with 10% AXF-I was found to negatively affect bread quality, i.e. decreased specific volume, harder crumb, darker crust color, and a coarser crumb structure. This effect was further investigated and to certain extent mitigated by modification of the recipe. In contrary to earlier studies, the application of xylanase did not further improve the quality of the AX-fortified bread. The current study shows the potential of AX-enriched fractions to be supplemented to bread to improved nutritional value, while maintaining high quality. There is no conflict of interest.',\n"," 'The sugarcane industry is an important economic segment and well developed in Brazil, making sugarcane ethanol the most successful alternative fuel program ever developed in the world [1]. According to the Brazilian National Supply Company [2], in 2017, approximately 28 billion liters of ethanol were produced in the country and with a continuously increase in the upcoming years. For each liter of ethanol obtained, between 9 and 14 L of the residue vinasse is produced [3]. Raw vinasse is mainly composed of water, inorganic minerals, suspended solids and organic pollutants such as phenolic and melanoidin compounds. It has a brown color, a corrosive low pH (3.5 – 5.0), a high chemical oxygen demand (70 – 150 g/L) and biochemical oxygen demand of 35 – 50 g/L. These characteristics make vinasse a complex residue to decompose [4] and its intensified use in agriculture cause nutrient saturation and pH increase, but it still is used as a fertilizer for sugarcane crop production. When discarded in water bodies, vinasse causes the dissolved oxygen to be consumed faster, compromising the aquatic biota [5]. Vinasse can also lixiviate into ground water, reaching and contaminating underground aquifers [6]. Therefore, it is important to the discarded vinasse undergo treatment before its release into the environment and/or to use it to obtain other products of economic interest. Vinasse degradation by microorganisms has proved to be an efficient form of treatment [7], specially by using the basidiomycete Pleurotus sajor-caju [8]. This biodegradation alternative may be further exploited since the fungus produces and excretes enzymes of commercial interest such as laccase (EC 1.10.3.2). Lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs) are types of enzymes produced by fungi that catalyze the breakdown of different organic and inorganic substrates. These enzymes have a great potential in biotechnological applications, such as in the food industry, delignification of cellulosic compounds, paper bleaching, degradation of synthetic dyes and pesticides in the soil [9], and in the breakdown against several micropollutants including already recognized endocrine disrupting chemicals at their natural residual concentrations [10]. Furthermore, the laccase production has attracted attention with the use of inducers as a strategy to increase its production using Ganoderma lucidum [11] and Pleurotus ostreatus fungi [12]. Aromatic compounds, such as pyrogallol and ferulic acid have been effective in stimulating laccase production by P. sajor-caju [13]. However, most of these compounds are harmful to humans and have a high cost, making it problematic in industrial applications. Some authors report that different alcohols can be more adequate and have an economic advantage to inducing production [11,14]. Another well-known inducer is copper, as it increases the laccase production by fungi due to the affinity of copper atoms at its catalytic site [15,16]. Depending on the application and commercial production, laccase must through a purification process. Among the most common techniques applied for laccase purification are filtration followed by membrane ultrafiltration [13], precipitation followed by dialysis [17], freezing and thawing followed by centrifugation [18] and by chromatographic techniques [19]. These techniques require several steps, which can cause increase in the final cost and loss of enzyme activity [20]. Liquid-liquid extraction by aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) can then be used as an alternative for the separation and purification of biomolecules such as proteins, enzymes and nucleic acids. This methodology has a low cost and guarantees excellent quality levels of purity and enzymatic activity [21,22]. ATPS is formed when two water-soluble compounds are mixed above its critical concentrations, resulting in two immiscible phases [23]. The separation process is the result of specific interactions between the solute and the phase-forming components. ATPS based on polymers and salts have been well explored for the purification of different enzymes [19,20,47], and a series of new constituents based on ionic liquids are being investigated [24]. However, the chemical cost is always important for any industrial separation process, and polymer ATPS are still recommended for commercial applications [19]. Therefore, it is important to consider the large volume of available biomass from the sugar-alcohol industry, that may contribute in adding commercial value to new sugarcane production chains as well as strengthening the creation of a chemical industry in a green economy [25]. In this sense, this work evaluated the laccase production from P. sajor-caju during the sugarcane vinasse biodegradation. For this purpose, different concentrations of inducers such as ethanol and copper sulfate were investigated. Moreover, it was proposed the use of ATPS based on polymers PEG (polyethylene glycol) and the study of various conditions, namely the polymer molecular weight and the constituent’s concentration in terms of their effects on the laccase purification. This section describes the materials and main procedures used in the production, induction and purification of P. sajor-caju laccase. The sugarcane vinasse used in this work was collected at the São José do Pinheiro power plant (10º46\\'10.8 \"S, 37º12\\'48.3\" W), located in the city of Laranjeiras, State of Sergipe, Brazil. The residue was collected in 5 L containers and kept refrigerated at −4 °C. P. sajor-caju was obtained from the São Paulo Botanical Institute, Brazil (under the code CCIBt 020) and kept refrigerated at 4 °C in Petri dishes containing MEA (malt extract agar) medium. The fungus was inoculated in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 mL of vinasse with pH 6.0, and previously autoclaved at 121 °C and 1 atm for 15 minutes. Upon cooling, these flasks were inoculated with three discs (1 cm in diameter) of culture medium containing the fungus mycelia. The flasks were incubated for 15 days in shaker at 180 rpm and 28 °C (±2 °C), under no light conditions, and samples were collected every 3 days. For the enzyme induction test, different concentrations of inducers were added to the vinasse containing medium and fermentation was carried out for 15 days. The inducers tested were ethanol (at 1, 2 and 3%, v/v) and CuSO4 (at 0.4, 0.6 and 1.0 mM). The supernatant was filtered and absorbance (abs) measured (λ =475 nm) using a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer. To calculate vinasse decolorization the following equation was applied:Decolorization (%) = [(absinitial - absfinal) / absinitial] x 100 Turbidity was measured using a portable HI 98703 turbidimeter and values expressed in NTU (Turbidity Nephelometric Units). The biomass was determined by the gravimetric method by drying it at 45 °C until constant weight was obtained. The total protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (1976) and a calibration curve was determined using bovine serum albumin as standard and values expressed as mg/L. Laccase activity was determined at 30 °C using a mixture of 0.3 mL of 0.05 M citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 5.0); 0.1 mL of syringaldazine solution, which is a reaction indicator, and 0.6 mL of the crude enzyme solution. Syringaldazine oxidation was measured by monitoring the increase in absorbance at a wavelength of 525 nm after 10 minutes of reaction. A unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to oxidize 1 μmol of syringaldazine per minute, with laccase activity expressed as unit of enzyme per liter of enzyme extract (U/L) [26]. The ATPSs were prepared in graduated centrifuge tubes by weighing the appropriate amounts of PEG, citrate buffer, distilled water and fermented broth (item 2.2) containing laccase. The tubes were shaken and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 minutes and placed in a thermostatic bath at 25 °C (±1 °C) and atmospheric pressure for 12 hours to achieve a thermodynamic equilibrium. The system top and bottom phases were carefully collected with a precision needle. All experiments were performed in triplicate and purification parameters were determined. The partition coefficient was defined as the protein concentration or enzymatic activity in the top phase, divided by the corresponding value in the bottom phase. KP is the protein partition coefficient and KE is the enzyme partition coefficient, which are found following the equations:KP = CT / CBKE = EAT / EABwhere CT is the total protein concentration (mg/L) in the top phase, CB is the total protein concentration in the bottom phase, EAT is the enzymatic activity (U/L) in the top phase and EAB is the enzymatic activity in the bottom phase. To evaluate the purification process, the specific enzyme activity (SA, U/mg protein) was calculated by equation (4), the enzyme recovered in the top (RET,%) and bottom (REB, %) phases were calculated by equations (5) and (6), respectively, after calculating the volumetric ratio between phases (RV), and finally the purification factor (PF), calculated according to equation (7). SA = EA / CRET = 100 / (1 + (1 / (RVKE)))REB = 100 / (1 + KVKE)PF = SA / SAiWhere the purification factor (PF) was calculated using the ratio between the specific activity (SA) in the top or bottom phases (depending on the stage in which the enzyme is concentrated) and the laccase specific activity (SAi) after the fermentation process. Cultivation of P. sajor-caju in vinasse was carried out for 15 days at 28 °C and 180 rpm of agitation. Due to the adaptation conditions of the P. sajor-caju fungus in the medium, the pH was adjusted to 6.0 since an acidic acid pH could cause enzyme denaturation [27]. In previous studies, the adjustment in the vinasse pH was shown to increase the residue degradation [7,8]. The laccase production is shown in Fig. 1, where we observe that the highest production occurred on the 6th day of cultivation with an activity of 130.3 U/L. For the same fungus and medium (100% vinasse) and through semi-solid fermentation Aguiar et al. [28] obtained a maximum laccase activity of 10.53 U/L during the first 6 days. Ferreira et al. [7] using submerged fermentation, obtained production of 400 U/L on the 9th day of cultivation and Vilar et al. [8] 400 U/L on the 12th day. These differences between enzymatic activities are due to factors such as the chemical composition of different vinasse batches, the processes for the residue generation and whether molasses was present in the broth. Laccase production by P. sajor-caju may vary depending on the growth conditions. Fokina et al. [16] yielded 70 U/L production in 7 days of culture in YGA (yeast extract-agar-glucose) medium at 28 °C and 120 rpm shaking. The effect of temperature and pH on the production of P. sajor-caju laccase was studied in modified Kirk medium, with varying temperature between 20 and 35 °C and pH between 4 and 6, and the optimum conditions were 30 °C, pH 6 and 135 rpm, with enzymatic activity of 620 U/L [29]. Another study used a liquid growth medium composed of minerals, where laccase activity of approximately 17 U/L was obtained on the 8th day of culture at 30 °C [30]. On an industrial scale, Liu et al. [31] produced laccase from Pycnoporus sp. reaching 80 U/mL in a 5-ton bioreactor using a medium composed of maltose, yeast extract and peptone. Consequently, laccase production may vary according to culture conditions, for example the pH, incubation temperature, fermentation time, agitation, culture medium, presence of inducers and the species of microorganism used [32,33]. Inducers are critical to increase enzyme production [12] and copper is well-known in the literature for elevating laccase activity considerably [16]. Concentrations of 1.0 mM and 0.6 mM CuSO4 (Fig. 2) resulted in maximal enzymatic activities of 285 and 505.5 U/L, respectively, on the 6th and 3rd day of culture. The highest laccase activity occurred on day 3 with 539.3 U/L, in the concentration of 0.4 mM CuSO4, a 4-fold increase difference from the control sample, which consisted of 100% vinasse medium. This supports the relevance in the use of laccase inducers to reduce fermentation time and the production costs. Nonetheless, this result corroborates with the data found by Manavalan et al. [11] for laccase production by Ganoderma lucidum, where a 7.5-fold increase in enzyme activity was achieved in nutrient medium with starch, supplemented with 0.4 mM CuSO4. Although the precise mechanisms are still under investigation, copper promotes production through the transcription of fungal laccase genes [34]. Another hypothesis is related to the copper atoms present in the catalytic site of the enzyme. By adding more copper to the medium, it acts as an enzymatic cofactor, increasing the number of functional groups associated with enzymatic catalysis and consequently increasing laccase activity [34]. For the fungus studied, lower copper concentrations gave a higher activity. Although copper is essential for inducing laccase production in basidiomycetes, there is an ideal amount needed for each species and an excessive amount leads to reduction in enzymatic activity. One of the explanations for this is that at high concentrations, copper acts as a potent inhibitor of fungus growth [9,35]. This was confirmed by Patrick et al. [29], where concentrations between 0.1 and 2.0 mM for P. sajor-caju laccase production were tested and the best results were obtained at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.2 mM. Another author obtained similar results, reaching high yields of Lentinus polychrous laccase in concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 mM CuSO4 and low yields at concentrations of 1.0 and 3.0 mM [15]. Similar results in laccase production in P. sajor-caju were found using 0.3 mM CuSO4 as inducer, where enzymatic activity was increased by 3.7 fold [29]. In another study, laccase production increased from 70 to 185 U/L by adding 1.0 mM CuSO4 at the 3rd day of inoculation [16]. The present work demonstrates an increase of 4-fold in enzymatic activity by using 0.4 mM CuSO4. The maximum peak of activity was observed with a reduced fermentation time from 6 to 3 days, in relation to the control sample (100% vinasse). The use of alcohols, such as ethanol, has been reported as a substitute for aromatic compounds (pyrogallol and ferulic acid) in inducing laccase production by P. sajor-caju, and making it more cost efficient [11]. A highest laccase activity (237.5 U/L) was observed on the 9th day of incubation with 1% ethanol addition. With a 2% ethanol addition, laccase activity increased to 364.5 U/L (2.8-fold) on the 6th day of cultivation. When ethanol concentration is increased to 3%, no laccase activity is detected. While the concentration of 1 and 2% of ethanol improved the enzyme activity and the biomass production, 3% of ethanol presented high toxicity on the microorganism growth and consequently no enzyme activity (Fig. 3). In Manavalan et al. [11], concentrations up to 5% ethanol were used to induce laccase production from the fungus G. lucidum. However, it is worth noting that different vinasse samples have different residual ethanol amounts as a result from the distillation process. This in part can influence the final ethanol concentration explaining why 3% ethanol inhibited fungal growth and laccase production in this study. Although ethanol is proposed as a laccase inducer, little is known about its mode of induction. Some authors suggest that ethanol can induce enzyme genes through oxidative stress, and/or cause membrane rupture, promoting enzyme secretion [36,37]. One factor that may affect the ethanol induction is the nitrogen found in the culture medium. Hernández et al. [14] induced the laccase production from Pycnoporus sanguineus using 3 g/L of ethanol and a source of simple (mineral) or complex (organic) nitrogen. Laccase activity of 31 U/L was obtained for ethanol and organic nitrogen source and 1.6 U/L for ethanol and mineral nitrogen source, showing that laccase production depends on the nitrogen source as well. Since vinasse is a complex organic form of nitrogen, the results here obtained are supported from the ones obtained by Hernández et al. [14]. For G. lucidum laccase production was induced by ethanol in all tested concentrations (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5% v/v). The highest production (2.5 U/mL, a 14-fold increase) was achieved with 3% ethanol in basal medium for 15 days at 30 °C, also demonstrating a high ethanol tolerance [11]. Fungal biomass is a versatile source for food additives, as well as for extracting antimicrobial compounds, aromas, polysaccharides and antioxidants (Kirsch et al., 2016). Within this scope, the cultivation of P. sajor-caju in vinasse medium with CuSO4 as an inducer resulted in a biomass accumulation of 10.08 g/L. Fig. 4 represents biomass concentration in different medium conditions. It is observed that the laccase activity is proportional to the biomass accumulation [8,31]. In a study that evaluated biomass production by P. sajor-caju using a medium containing vinasse and sugarcane bagasse, during the 30 days of fermentation, found 117.87 g/L of fungal biomass produced. This value was attributed to the highly nutritive nature of the medium with bagasse [28]. Using the same fungus species, Vilar et al. [8] obtained a biomass production of 22.06 g/L in medium containing vinasse enriched with glucose, showing the importance of glucose for biomass production. In another study, the relationship between biomass production and laccase was studied by cultivating the fungus in mineral solution where 5.2 g/L of biomass was associated with a high laccase activity (40 U/mL) [38]. Vinasse is highly polluting and contains tannic acid, humic acid and melanoidines, which give its characteristic dark color. These phenolic compounds are recalcitrant biopolymers derived from the Maillard reaction where amino acids react with reducing carbohydrates [4,39]. Therefore, it is fundamental to apply an adequate treatment to reduce its color and turbidity for a safe discard in the environment or re-utilization in industrial processes. In this study, the processes of decolorization and turbidity removal begins upon the 3rd day of fermentation (Fig. 5). The highest values achieved were 92% and 99.2% for color removal and turbidity, respectively, after the 15th day of culture in medium without addition of inducers. The values of decolorization and removal of turbidity presented in this study are close to those already described in the literature [7]. The decolorization and turbidity reduction of vinasse is due to the activity of enzymes, which attack the recalcitrant compounds responsible for this characteristic color [8]. These results show the consistency of our data using P. sajor-caju for the vinasse biological treatment. Vinasse decolorization was better achieved in the media containing inducers (from 81 to 92%). The same occurred for turbidity removal, whereas all CuSO4-induced samples obtained were between 97.8 % and 99%. Those induced by 1% and 2% ethanol obtained 92.6 and 97.8% turbidity reduction, respectively. The 3% ethanol concentration did not display any decolorization or turbidity removal of the medium in P. sajor-caju presence. The probable reason, as stated before, might be due that alcohol becomes toxic to P. sajor-caju at this concentration, thus halting the fungus to develop. Studies report on the decolorization and turbidity removal from vinasse using other treatments and microorganisms. Values of 89.7% decolorization and 79.2% turbidity removal were obtained by treating the residue with the microorganisms present in activated sludge and in several process steps (fermentation with a high flow system, filtration, chemical flocculation, fermentation with a low flow system, neutralization and disinfection) [40]. Thanapimmetha et al. [41] obtained 88.5% color removal from vinasse by using an electro-Fenton process. Rodríguez et al. [42] used an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor to treat vinasse through microbial communities (bacteria and archaea) while the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium was used by Dahiya et al. [43] to obtain 80% decolorization. This color removal is attributed to melanoidin degradation, and for biological treatments, this is due to the enzymatic activity of the microorganisms employed. The results show that the addition of CuSO4 and ethanol as laccase inducers does not interfere in the melanoidin degradation. Synthesis and excretion of laccase by the fungus continues to occur, consequently breaking down these complex compounds in the vinasse. The P. sajor-caju efficiency in decoloring vinasse and its capacity to degrade recalcitrant compounds was proven in this work, corroborating with others in the literature [7,8], where high rates of decolorization and reduction of turbidity were achieved. Systems based on PEG and citrate buffer were used to purify laccase from vinasse degradation by P. sajor-caju. The systems were initially prepared using 10 wt% of PEG 4000 + 15 wt% of citrate buffer + 30 wt% enzyme broth + water at 25 °C. The data of composition for the biphasic systems formed by PEG and citrate buffer were previously described in the literature [44]. The laccase partition at different pH values (5.0, 6.0 and 7.0) was investigated in ATPS (salt-rich phase). Enzymes are formed by amino acid residues in the active site that have acidic or basic properties and are important for catalysis. Changes in pH values can affect these residues and cause enzymatic denaturation. Table 1 shows the effect of pH on the enzymatic activity of recovered laccase in the top and bottom phases of the ATPS. The most active laccase was observed at pH 6, with 507.2 ± 24.3 U/L for the PEG-rich phase. Higher and lower pH values led to a significant decrease in laccase activity and purification factor. This same behavior was observed by Silvério et al. [45] regarding the stability of commercial laccase from T. versicolor with different pH buffers. In addition, it is possible to observe the laccase partition to the PEG-rich phase (KE > 1). The isoelectric point (pI) of the enzyme laccase is 4.5 [46], this suggests that the bottom-phase (salt-rich phase) at pH 6, amino acid residues of the enzyme are partially negatively charged, which may justify the laccase partition into top phase (PEG-rich). This phenomenon was observed by other authors [19,43]. The influence of pH (5.8 to 8.0) on the partition of phenylalanine dehydrogenase in PEG/ammonium sulfate ATPS was investigated by Mohamadi et al. [47]. The pH increase above the pI of the protein, the net negative charge of the protein increased, favoring the interaction between the protein and the PEG-rich phase, consequently increasing the partition coefficient. The further steps of purification and optimization were then conducted in ATPS using pH 6.0. To improve the purification of laccase from P. sajor-caju, different molar mass of PEG were investigated (1500, 4000, 6000 and 8000 g/mol). The systems were prepared at fixed concentrations of 10 wt% of PEG + 15 wt% of citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 25 °C. The enzyme partition coefficient (KE) and purification factor (PF) of laccase are showed in Fig. 6. The laccase partition to the top phase (PEG-rich phase) of the system was observed for all investigated systems. PEG of smaller molecular weight (1500 and 4000 g/mol) resulted in greater migration of laccase to the top phase compared to PEG of larger molecular weight, such as 6000 and 8000 g/mol (Fig. 6). These results led to the increase of the laccase purification factor (PF) in the top phase for the smallest weight polymers, especially for the PEG 1500 system with a PF ≈ 2.1, while for the system with PEG 8000 a PF ≈ 1.0 was found. According to Ratanapongleka [48], increasing the PEG molar mass results in an exclusion effect, causing a reduction in the free volume and making the polymer to a more hydrophobic and compact conformation. This makes it difficult to partition the protein to the top phase. The results corroborate with those described by Sánchez-Trasviña et al. [49], where Trametes versicolor laccase had a preference for the top phase of the system formed by PEG and potassium phosphate, and by increasing the PEG molar mass, the recovery of laccase in the PEG-rich phase was decreased. Furthermore, polymers of high molecular weight strongly increase the viscosity of the medium that results in difficulties to enlarge the scale and in effect of denaturation to proteins, therefore, not suitable for ATPS. In addition to molecular weight, the choice of the PEG concentration has the significant effect on the enzyme partition in ATPS. The effect of polymer concentration was investigated for system composed with PEG 1500 (10 – 18 wt%) + citrate buffer at pH 6.0 (15 wt%). Table 2 shows the laccase purification and recovery factors at the top and bottom phases. The hydrophobic interaction between the PEG and the enzyme surface increases with increasing polymer concentration up to the 12 wt% of PEG and PF ≈ 2.3. PEG concentrations above 12 wt% made the purification factor decrease, probably because of the increase in viscosity and interfacial tension between the phases, making it difficult the migration of laccase into the top phase [50]. Kirincic and Klofutar [51] showed that the increase in molecular weight of PEG (400 - 20000) increased the viscosity of the aqueous PEG solution from 4.41 cm3/g to 42.02 cm3/g, respectively. The effect of citrate buffer (pH 6.0) concentration (15 – 24 wt%) was also investigated (Table 2). The increase in salt concentration promoted both recovery and purification of the laccase to the top phase of the system. The enzyme recovery changed of 99.81 % to 99.92 % and a PF of 2.31 to 2.88, from the systems with 15 wt% to 20 wt% of citrate buffer (pH 6,0) + 12 wt% of PEG 1500 + water, at 25 °C. The effect of salt concentration on the system was clearly influenced by the salt-out ability of the salt used [52], whereby the enzymes are partially hydrated with increasing salt concentration and easily expelled to the opposite phase (PEG rich phase). At concentrations above 20 wt% PF decreased considerably, probably due to the increase in density at the salt-rich phase [50]. Mayolo-Deloisa et al. [50] obtained a purification factor of 2.48 and recovery of 95% when using a similar system consisting of PEG 1000 and potassium phosphate to recover laccase produced by Agaricus bisporus. Ratanapongleka (2012) purified laccase from Lentinus polychrous to 1.98-fold, with a 99% recovery, in PEG 4000 and potassium phosphate systems. P. sapidus laccase was also purified to 1.68-fold, a recovery yield of 105% for the top phase of a PEG 3000 and phosphate system [21]. More recently, Rajagopalu et al. [22] obtained a purification factor of 8.03 fold and an recovery of 99.4% of laccase from Hericium erinaceus in the bottom phases of ATPS formed by PEG 8000 + phosphate buffer. This developed process for the purification of laccase produced from vinasse substrates using PEG is effective and suppresses enzyme denaturation. In addition, the ATPS makes use of citrate salt making it a more sustainable process due to the biodegradable and non-toxic nature of citrate. Pleurotus sajor-caju was used to produce laccase enzyme with simultaneous degradation of vinasse to ethanol production. The presence of inducers, during the degradation and consequently laccase production, was significantly influenced by the presence of the copper ion. The maximum activity of the laccase enzyme was ≈ 539.3 U / L on the 3rd day of fermentation with 0.4 mM CuSO4. Under these conditions, the final treated vinasse had a ≈ 92% discoloration and ≈ 99% turbidity removal. In addition, the produced laccase was then purified by ATPS in a single purification step. Factors such as composition and pH of the phases (12 wt% PEG 1500 + 20 wt% citrate buffer (pH 6.0) + enzyme broth + water) were crucial for the separation process. The laccase was then purified ≈ 2.9-fold, with recovery of ≈ 99.9% to the upper phase (PEG-rich phase). Therefore, this study successfully used inducers to stimulate enzymatic production and reduce the vinasse polluting potential, thus adding value to the by-product. In addition, these results also indicate that the use of ATPS is a promising method for the purification of laccase from P sajor-caju and this partially purified extract can be a suitable biocatalyst for a large number of industrial processes.

This increase in the use of laminated timber is driven by a combination of site, construction, environmental, and aesthetic considerations. However, fire safety is widely perceived to limit applications of tall timber buildings, due to both the inherent combustibility of timber, as compared with non-combustible structural framing materials such as reinforced concrete or steel (both of which present their own particular challenges in structural fire engineering design), and to the historical reality that serious conflagrations have occurred in the past in cities that were constructed largely from timber (e.g. Great Fires of London, Chicago [1,2]). The issue of structural fire safety design in tall timber buildings with significant amounts of exposed mass timber has recently been the topic of research and debate within the fire safety community. Some authors (e.g. [3]) have suggested that, rather than simply being required to demonstrate an ability to meet the prescriptive fire resistance ratings currently suggested in building design guidance, tall mass timber structures ought to be designed instead so that auto-extinction of exposed timber occurs once the moveable fuel load has burned out in a fire. The design objectives should in this case not be measured via prescriptive fire resistance requirements but rather aimed at achieving an acceptable level of safety by considering design fires more appropriate for exposed mass timber construction. Proof of concept of the ability to achieve burn out in timber compartments with various specific configurations, and with partial encapsulation of timber surfaces by non-combustible cladding, has been demonstrated in multiple large-scale [4–6] and medium-scale [7] experiments. The available data suggest that this can be achieved at critical mass loss rates between 3.5 g/m2s [6,8] and 3.9 g/m2s [9] to obtain auto-extinction for fire-exposed timber (Radiata Pine in this case). The configuration of a compartment, the moveable fuel load, the compartment size and ventilation, the number, size, and orientation of exposed timber surfaces, and – importantly – the potential for fall-off of charred timber lamella during a fire, are all considered likely to play roles in influencing whether auto-extinction will occur for a given compartment. A key requirement for structural design for fire in England and Wales, and most other jurisdictions globally, is that buildings should maintain stability and prevent the spread of fire for a reasonable period [10]. Interestingly, the corresponding European directive [11] refers to maintenance of stability for a specific period of time. This is to allow for safe evacuation, to protect the safety of first responders, and – although rarely explicitly stated – can be expected to provide some measure of property, environmental, and business continuity protection. Compliance with the above requirements is typically achieved through a framework of ‘fire resistance ratings’ which is historically based on standard furnace testing. This is a design and assessment approach wherein isolated building elements are exposed to a specified time-temperature curve in a standardised fire testing furnace until they fail either by loss of load bearing capacity or by losing their ability to adequately maintain fire compartmentation. The temperature in the furnace can either be controlled using thermocouples [13], in which case a measure of the gas phase temperature is used as the control, or through plate thermometers [14] which provide control via the so-called adiabatic surface temperature; this represents a combination of radiation and convection temperatures. Regardless of the control instrumentation used, the achieved fire resistance rating (quoted as a duration in time) provides a relative performance assessment of the building element when tested under standardised heating conditions and in isolation. This cannot generally be directly translated into the structural performance of real buildings in real fires [15,16] for a wide range of reasons which need not be discussed here. Structural fire design guidance documents, for example EN 1995-1-2 [17] for structural timber, currently offer both simplified and more advanced calculation methods to assess the fire resistance or variation in load bearing capacity of timber elements in fire. Guidance for both the simplified methods, e.g. the reduced cross-section method (RCSM), and the more advanced methods, e.g. non-linear finite element analysis, is strictly applicable only to standard fire exposures. Available design methods therefore represent simplified attempts to design to achieve the fire resistances that would be obtained for elements when assessed in standard furnace tests. These are thus relative assessments between fire resistance periods that cannot be used for design optimisation (e.g. CLT layup and compartment geometry), nor can they properly assess the structural performance of timber elements in real (i.e. non-standard heating) fires. Furthermore, it is notable that in real fires the fire dynamics may also depend considerably on the materials of construction. Thus, standard fires may have limited relevance or applicability for mass timber buildings with exposed timber surfaces. This paper seeks to highlight various reasons why more fundamental design approaches may be needed to assure adequate structural response to fire in these situations. When exposed to fire, timber will pyrolyse and under sufficient heating will turn to char which is typically assumed to have negligible strength or stiffness [18,19]. Beneath the char layer however, the heat-affected timber within the element will retain some fraction of its ambient temperature strength, depending on its temperature, moisture content, and the specific type and direction of loading (with respect to the grain direction in particular) [20]. The thermal (i.e. insulating) properties of the char layer, as well as the increased distance between the heated surface and the in-depth pyrolysis front, provides thermal protection to the timber beneath the char, particularly under rapid heating conditions, and results in a steep in-depth temperature gradient in the uncharred timber and a shallow thermal penetration depth (this may be defined as timber that is heated above ambient temperature). Available research [21] suggests that the thermal penetration depth is typically 25 to 35 mm at any time between 30 and 90 min during standard fire exposure. The most widely used method for structural fire design of mass timber elements is the RCSM. This is currently set out in EN 1995-1-2 [17] and assumes that an effective reduction in the size of the cross section during fire can be approximated by using a constant rate of charring and ‘lumping’ losses in strength and stiffness of the heat affected timber beneath the char line into a ‘zero strength layer (ZSL)’. Current guidance assigns a depth of 7 mm to the ZSL. The resulting reduced cross-section is then assumed to respond as though it is at ambient temperature, and its load bearing capacity is assessed using ambient temperature design methods and mechanics. The ZSL value of 7 mm was determined during the 1980s via modelling, and was ‘validated’ against a single test on a glulam beam in bending under standard fire conditions [22]. Several researchers have since shown that a constant value of 7 mm should not be used for timber subjected to non-standard loading or heating conditions, or particularly for CLT [23–27] in compression or hogging. As a consequence, multiple values for the ZSL have been proposed in recent years as alternatives to the 7 mm which is currently suggested for use in design. These proposals attempt to account for the loading condition [24] and the potential fire resistance (via the total thickness) [28]. In some jurisdictions, an alternative RCSM is recommended. In North America, for instance, the ZSL is assumed to vary as a function of the charring depth, and hence as a function of the required fire resistance [29,30]. If fire strategy designers employ a defend-in-place approach (where fires are expected to be contained within the compartment of fire origin) [3] for a mass timber building with exposed timber surfaces, then it is essential that burn out (i.e. auto-extinguishment) should occur without loss of stability or fire compartmentation. During burn out, as all moveable fuel load is consumed, the gas phase compartment temperatures will reduce and any charring of exposed timber stops (notwithstanding the potential for smouldering combustion under certain conditions that are not treated in the current paper). The heated timber below the char layer will also eventually cool, although a thermal wave will continue to transfer heat deeper into the cross section even after temperatures begin to reduce at the heated surface. This will continue to reduce the strength and stiffness of the timber element for some time beyond burnout. The above concern has previously been noted by several researchers [31–34], however it is not yet explicitly accounted for in any widely applied timber structural fire design guidance. Results from recent furnace tests on large glulam timber columns, undertaken to simulate burnout and assess structural fire response under auto-extinction scenarios, show that in-depth temperatures continue to increase long after the fire exposure is halted [35]; in this specific case in-depth heating continues for at least 240 min after 90 min of standard fire exposure. This thermal wave of continued in-depth heating after extinction, which has also been observed to occur for reinforced concrete [36] and protected structural steelwork [37], constitutes a hazard for timber structures. This hazard exists because significant heat induced deterioration of mechanical properties for timber can be expected at lower temperatures (i.e. from approximately 60 °C) than for structural steel or reinforced concrete (above 250 °C or higher) and the structural consequences for timber may therefore be greater where heating of deep timber sections occurs both during and after the burning phase of a compartment fire. In light of the thermo-mechanical interactions highlighted above, this paper describes and then quantifies in illustrative terms the thermal wave – which can also be considered a redistribution of heat – in real burnout scenario experiments on timber compartments with significant amounts of exposed timber. The purpose of this work is to quantify potential ongoing reductions in load bearing capacity during cooling in the decay phase. In addition, the temperature development in the cross-section and the implications of this on the load bearing capacity during the decay phase are quantified and discussed. Five full-scale compartment fire experiments on CLT compartments with differing amounts of exposed CLT surfaces were performed primarily to investigate the influence of exposed timber surfaces on compartment fire dynamics and the potential for auto-extinction. Full details of these experiments are given by Hadden et al. [4]. In these experiments the CLT compartment walls were instrumented with Inconel sheathed K-type thermocouples with an outer diameter of 1.5 mm. These were inserted at specified depths via drilling from the back (i.e. unexposed) face of the timber. For this purpose 2 mm wide holes were drilled to within 8 mm of the target depth and the remaining depth was drilled to a 1.5 mm diameter. This ensured that the thermocouple could be inserted into the hole, but achieved a snug fit near the thermocouple tip. Mobile drill stands were used to ensure that the deviation angle of attack of the holes was minimised and that the drill depth was as accurate as possible. Thin skin calorimeters (TSCs) [38] were positioned on the exposed surfaces of the CLT within the compartment to estimate the incident heat fluxes to the timber during the experiments. The total heat release rate (HRR) was measured by oxygen consumption calorimetry, as was the mass loss rate for the compartment fuel load which consisted of timber cribs, flow velocities within the compartment opening, temperatures throughout the compartment in the gas-phase, and heat fluxes at specified distances outside the compartment opening. The current paper focuses on the in-depth temperature measurements in the exposed CLT walls during heating and cooling. All of the CLT panels in the experiments were composed of five timber lamellae, each 20 mm in thickness and face (but not edge) bonded with a one-component polyurethane (PUR) adhesive. The timber was graded to a C24 strength class [39], and as such the lamellae can be expected to have a mean density of 420 kg/m3. All wall and ceiling parts were stored outside for several weeks before being left indoors for several days before the experiments. The spatial mean moisture content of the CLT walls immediately before the experiments were performed was measured as 13.3% with a sample standard error of 0.3%. Ventilation was provided via a single compartment opening, 1.84 m in height (starting at floor level) and 0.8 m wide. The internal dimensions of the compartment were 2.72 m in both width and length, and 2.77 m in height. The use of slightly different encapsulation systems on protected walls between different experiments meant that these dimensions varied slightly (±100 mm). Each of the experiments was assigned a name according to its specific configuration in terms of the number and position of exposed internal timber surfaces. Alpha-configuration refers to experiments where one side wall and the back wall (i.e. opposite from the compartment opening) were exposed; Beta-configuration refers to the ceiling and the back wall being exposed; and Gamma-configuration refers to the back wall, one side wall, and the ceiling being exposed. The positions of the thermocouples across the surface of the CLT elements are shown in Fig. 1. Thermocouples for ‘high density’ instrumentation points (referring to the legend in Fig. 1) were placed at target depths of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, and 80 mm from the fire-exposed surface. For the ‘low-density’ instrumentation points the chosen depths were every 20 mm from the exposed surface. Any deviations from the targeted (i.e. desired) thermocouple depths were recorded, and the actual installed depths were subsequently used in analyses. The resulting mean vertical placement error between targeted and achieved depth was −0.4 mm with a standard error of the mean of 0.19 mm. All thermocouples were spaced at least 10 mm from each other, in order to minimise the influence on temperature readings between the thermocouples. Of the three configurations of compartment examined in these experiments (i.e. Alpha, Beta, and Gamma), two were of these were performed in duplicate. Three distinct burning scenarios that were observed are of primary interest in the current paper; these are shown in Fig. 2. The full experimental results are given by Hadden et al. [4]. For Experiment Beta 1 with back wall and ceiling exposed, auto-extinction of the exposed timber was achieved shortly after the compartment fuel load was consumed. This behaviour is clearly evidenced by the HRR curve (Fig. 2a). For Experiment Beta 2, which was a repeat of Experiment Beta 1, a comparable reduction in HRR was observed after the initial steady burning phase, however char fall-off of the first layer of timber lamellae after about 20 min of fire exposed additional fuel, leading to an increase in burning and increased temperatures and HRR; this process was repeated multiple times as deeper lamellae charred and fell off, exposing unburned timber each time. This cyclic behaviour is clearly evident in Fig. 2b. Experiment Beta 2 was manually extinguished shortly after a third cycle in HRR increase was observed. Experiment Gamma, with three exposed surfaces, displayed HRR and compartment temperatures that remained elevated after experiencing an initial peak. The timber continued to burn and char (with some char fall-off occurring albeit with no discernible distinct influence on the burning regime) until the fire was manually extinguished after 80 min (Fig. 2c). The precise fire dynamics of these burning regimes is not the focus of the current paper; and in any case this has already been presented elsewhere [4,6]. The Alpha configuration is not included in the current analysis since it is more relevant to a discussion of auto-extinction and the thermal insult is not expected to vary greatly from other experiments where no auto-extinction occurred (e.g. Gamma1). Fig. 3 shows the variation of in-depth temperatures in the ceiling CLT panel with time experiments Beta1, Beta2, and Gamma1. For each scenario, the mean temperatures across all thermocouple locations where the same in-depth temperature measurements were taken (refer to Fig. 1) are given, along with shaded areas showing one standard deviation from the mean of the readings at these locations. The heated depth is shown for 60 °C, 100 °C, and 200 °C, as is the char depth assumed on the basis of a 300 °C isotherm which is typical in fire research on timber. A 60 °C isotherm has been included in these plots because irreversible changes in the timber’s mechanical properties have been suggested to occur in this range [40]. A temperature of 100 °C has been used because of its significance for moisture loss, and because prior studies have shown that reductions in strength and stiffness of timber are most pronounced up to this point with less severe reductions of mechanical properties above 100 °C [41–44]. An isotherm for 200 °C is also shown because temperatures of 200 °C are often used to signify the onset of pyrolysis [45]. At 300 °C pyrolysis of the timber is assumed to be complete [18,42,46]. To determine the heated depths shown in Fig. 3, discrete temperature readings at various depths were used to fit a spline curve with a smoothing parameter of 0.1 (note that a smoothing parameter of zero fits a linear regression curve, whereas a smoothing parameter of unity fits a piecewise polynomial curve which passes through all data points precisely) at each time step. This was repeated for each location, each experiment, and each exposed timber surface. Variation of thermal penetration depths with time were then determined from the resulting curve fits based on the deepest distance from the fire exposed timber surface where the corresponding temperature was measured. It is noteworthy that a trade-off exists in choosing a value for the smoothing parameter. A linear fit (i.e. smoothing parameter = 0) fails to capture steep temperature gradients and therefore leads to conservative results and an overestimation of loss of structural capacity. Conversely, a smoothing parameter close to unity will reduce the interpolation performance between thermocouple depths and result in large scatter, thereby corrupting the fundamental purpose of the fitting exercise. The authors have arbitrarily selected a curve fitting parameter of 0.1, since it appears to give a reasonable balance between these competing constraints. The spatial mean charring rate over all thermocouple positions in the ceiling panels for Beta1, Beta2, and Gamma1 experiments is shown in Fig. 4, again along with shaded areas showing one standard deviation from the mean at each position. An initial peak charring rate is observed early in all three experiments. This subsequently reduced due to the formation of a char layer with a quasi-steady depth, which insulated the underlying timber causing the pyrolysis front to gradually progress in depth. The base charring rate for solid timber, i.e. 0.65 mm/min, provided in the Eurocodes [17] is also shown in these plots. It should be noted that the charring rates presented here were not measured directly, but have been calculated from the location of the 300 °C isotherm using the method validated by Bartlett et al. [47] for cross-laminated timber panels. No final charring depths were measured, resulting in some uncertainty about the final depths. A detailed description of charring depths and rates across the walls and ceilings is a work in progress and will be dealt with in a separate publication. Experiment Beta1 displays a charring rate that reduces to zero almost immediately after auto-extinction (see Fig. 3a). For the other two experiments shown, multiple peaks in the charring rate are observed as the burning duration progresses. These are likely caused by successive localised char fall-off, thereby exposing uncharred timber to the fire and temporarily increasing the local charring rate. This is considered to be the main driver for the cyclic increase and decrease in the HRR shown in Fig. 1b. A similar behaviour can be observed in plots of charring rates for the back walls (Fig. 6). For the wall in Experiment Beta 1 (Fig. 6a) a second peak in the charring rate is evident; this is most likely caused by local char fall-off, yet any additional fuel contribution from this appears not to have been sufficient to prevent subsequent auto-extinction in this case. Additional research is needed to better understand the various parameters potentially affecting auto-extinction so that structural fire engineering designers can make confident design assumptions regarding the prognosis that this will occur (or not) in real design scenarios. For all experiments presented here it is observed that, where no peaks in charring rate occur, the charring rates stabilise close to the base charring rate of 0.65 mm/min. This behaviour is already well documented and utilised for modern design approaches to the charring rate, which additionally recommend an increase in the base charring rate when char fall-off is expected to occur [48]. In Figs. 3 and 5 it is clear that the temperature development for Experiment Beta1, in which auto-extinction occurred, is fundamentally different from the other two cases presented. Auto-extinction occurs at around 20 min for Beta1, and subsequently the depth of the char layer (i.e. the 300 °C isotherm) remains constant indicating that charring has effectively stopped. All strength and stiffness in the char are assumed to be irrecoverably lost. Thus, despite the 300 °C isotherm retreating upon cooling, the formation of char is permanent and irreversible. After charring stops, however, the thermal wave continues to progress deeper into the uncharred timber. For example, the depth of the 200 °C isotherm continues to increase for an additional 10 min in this case, before cooling dominates. The 100 °C isotherm, which is associated with considerable reductions in mechanical properties (e.g. 75% loss of strength and 65% loss of elastic modulus [17]) of the timber, continues to progress into the element for 30 min beyond burnout. For the 60 °C isotherm this progression continues until the experiment is terminated (i.e. the instrumentation is switched off and water is applied to arrest smouldering). Experiments Beta2 and Gamma1 did not experience auto-extinction. This is reflected in the charring depth plots in Figs. 3 and 5, which show char depth increases up until the point of extinction in both cases. It is noteworthy that data for experiments Beta2 and Gamma1 are more erratic; this can be attributed to the occurrence of spatially non-uniform char fall-off that was observed directly during the experiments. This leads to sudden localised loss of the insulating char and therefore localised increases in charring rate and internal temperatures in these locations; this manifests in the data as increased variation about the mean values. Comparing Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 5(a), the standard deviation between the measured locations varies between the ceiling and back wall measurements for Experiment Beta1. This is not observed for experiments Beta2 and Gamma1, where differences between measurement locations were influenced by the occurrence of char fall-off and the changing fire dynamics within the compartments as already noted. Also, owing to the increased burning durations of Beta2 and Gamma1 as compared with Beta1, these fires progressed to become ventilation controlled ‘Regime I’ fires [49], while Experiment Beta1 did not last long enough to establish a deep smoke layer, and the walls were therefore subjected to spatially varying heat fluxes (compared with the ceiling, which was exposed to a more uniform hot smoke layer) with height from the plume from the original fuel load, i.e. a ‘Regime II’ fire [49]. It is also noteworthy that in the final stages of Experiment Gamma1 the temperature readings in the back wall appear somewhat erratic. This is likely because forced extinction was applied to this wall through water spray, thus causing rapid cooling of the wall. This is not seen for the ceiling, which instead cooled due to reduced compartment temperatures. Another observation from Figs. 3 and 5 is that the increase in char depth and thermal penetration in Experiment Beta2, thought to be caused at least partly by fall-off of char, occurs when the calculated char depth is less than 20 mm (the width of each of the individual lamellae). This suggests that char fall-off at glue lines may in some cases occur before the 300 °C isotherm penetrates to the glue line; this could possibly be due to softening/weakening of glue lines. Additional research is needed to better understand, quantify, and prevent char fall-off. The current paper examines thermal penetration into the CLT panels and its potential (theoretical) consequences for their load bearing capacities in both bending and axial compression. From the observed temperatures in Figs. 3a and 5a it is clear that a thermal wave continues to propagate in-depth after burnout and auto-extinction. The areas heated between 200 °C and 300 °C reduce in the cases shown, whereas additional timber is heated to 100 °C. From a structural fire engineering perspective this is problematic, since the majority of loss of strength and stiffness for timber occurs up to 100 °C and is complete by 300 °C. According to the Structural Eurocodes [17], timber loses 75% and 65% of its compressive strength and stiffness parallel to the grain, respectively, at 100 °C when heated under standard fire conditions. Whilst these losses in mechanical properties have been derived for standard fire exposures they agree reasonably well with empirical studies on heated timber [43], and are therefore considered to be sufficiently applicable for the illustrative analyses presented in the current paper. Thus, the post burnout thermal wave phenomenon appears likely to be significant for timber elements. The increase of temperatures in the decay phase after burnout is not typically considered in structural fire design for timber, and the specific consequences of this are currently unknown to the knowledge of the authors. This concern is particularly relevant for buildings with defend-in-place fire strategies and when accounting for fire service intervention considerations. The following sections provide a quantification of the theoretical magnitudes of additional decay phase loss of load-bearing capacity in both flexural and compressive loading scenarios for CLT elements. The section ends with special consideration given to glulam columns supporting compressive loads. To assess the structural load bearing capacity of CLT elements based on the temperatures measured in the experiments presented above, the measured temperatures were fitted to smoothing functions to give approximate in-depth temperature gradients through the timber sections. These were then used, in conjunction with a computational cross-sectional analysis program, and the timber mechanical property reduction curves given in Eurocode 5 [17], to predict the remaining strength and stiffness of the timber with temperature and location over the cross-section, and hence the overall load bearing capacity in bending (in this section) or compression (in the following section). The normal cross-sectional analysis assumptions that are widely used within structural engineering are deployed herein; it is assumed that plane sections remain plane for all loading conditions and that shear deformations between the timber lamellae can be ignored. This is based on the assumption that shear deformations in CLT become negligible for span to depth ratios of greater than 20 [51]. In addition, recent research has demonstrated that rolling shear failure is unlikely in fire exposed CLT members [52]. The current analysis is concerned with the theoretical relative strength loss throughout a real compartment fire, notably including a decay phase and the influence of the previously noted thermal wave. Before the distribution of elastic modulus over a cross-section can be determined, the depth of the neutral axis must be assumed since the reduction of the elastic modulus of timber with increasing temperature varies depending on whether timber is in tension or compression [17]. The elastic modulus distribution is in turn needed to determine the neutral axis depth; hence, an iterative analysis approach is required. At each assumed curvature, an initial estimation of the neutral axis location is used to find the elastic modulus distribution over the cross-section. From this, the stress distribution is determined as the product of elastic modulus and strain in each elemental slice. The actual neutral axis depth is then found via Newton-Raphson iterations to ensure axial equilibrium over the cross-section, and this then updates the elastic modulus for each slice and thus the assumed stress distribution In compression, the stress-strain behaviour of the timber is assumed to be elastic-perfectly plastic. Once the compressive yield strength, which also reduces with increasing temperature in assumed accordance with the Structural Eurocodes, is exceeded, yielding is assumed to occur and plasticity is applied to the affected elements, i.e. the stress is not increased beyond the assumed yield strength. In this way, the curvature is increased linearly until either the tensile strength or the ultimate strain in compression are exceeded in any elemental slice. Failure of the cross-section, and thus its ultimate flexural capacity, can then be computed from the stress distribution and the determined neutral axis depth. This is similar to a procedure suggested for analysis of timber at ambient conditions by Buchanan [53], with the additional consideration of thermally induced variations in strength and stiffness in accordance with the reduction curves suggested by Eurocode 5 [17]. The basic process for the above calculation procedure is shown schematically in Fig. 7, which shows the temperature distribution in the timber at various times during Experiment Beta1. Alongside the temperatures are the respective strain and stress distributions at failure. Timber is widely assumed to be elastic-brittle in tension and elastic-plastic in compression [54,55]. Tensile failure usually occurs where defects like knots or wanes exist in a cross-section. This has consequences for the design of timber members because the weakest point therefore governs bulk behaviour in tension. In bending, a smaller area is subjected to tensile stresses than in the case of pure tension, and thus the probability of randomly occurring defects causing a tensile failure reduces for elements in bending. The stress distribution must therefore be considered to assess the tensile failure strength in bending. The calculations given herein are concerned with relative loss of structural capacity, and thus the reliance on choosing the correct material input parameters is minimal. Strength values at ambient temperature for the analyses were chosen in accordance with EN 338 [39] for a C24 timber strength class. There is a paucity of available data on the yield and ultimate strain of heated timber in compression. Buchanan [56] proposes values between 0.004 and 0.05; a value of 0.05 was chosen for the simulations presented herein. This upper bound was chosen to assess the consequences of a ‘best case’ scenario, i.e. what is the worst that can happen under ‘good’ conditions. The theoretical normalised bending capacity during the burning duration of the ceilings from the three aforementioned experiments is given in Fig. 8 for two possible scenarios: (1) a case where all losses of strength and stiffness of (uncharred) timber due to temperature are assumed to be fully recoverable, and (2) where strength and stiffness losses due to increased temperature are assumed to be fully irrecoverable, even for uncharred timber. The reality will lie somewhere between these two extremes. The authors are not aware of any available research that lends strong preference towards either of these assumptions at present. The temperature data from the centre of the ceilings, where the highest bending moments can be expected to occur for simply-supported elements, have been used in the current analysis. Also displayed in Fig. 8 are alternative calculation results in which the experimental charring rate is used; however, instead of using the experimental heating data, a ZSL of 7 mm, as currently recommended in Eurocode 5 [17] for standard heating scenarios [12], is substituted to account for the reductions in strength of thermally affected timber beneath the char layer. The 7 mm ZSL was chosen over other available, and possibly improved, ZSL models simply for illustration and because the 7 mm value is currently codified in multiple national standards for the use of timber – and it has actually been used for the structural fire design of timber buildings. From Fig. 8a, it is observed that reductions in ultimate bending capacity for the CLT slab after extinction are relatively minor in this case, if recovery of heated timber is assumed, and are unlikely to cause failure after burn out for the case of a severe but short fire that achieves auto-extinction. It is noteworthy that this fire has a burning duration of only about 21 min. If no strength and stiffness recovery is assumed, a continued loss of bending capacity can be observed after extinction for Experiment Beta1. This continued loss of capacity is proportional to the reductions that occur before extinction and is reasonably well captured by the RCSM method. The RCSM and the more advanced cross-sectional analysis method based agree well during the first 20 min of the fire; i.e. as the first lamella of the CLT chars under steep thermal gradients. This should be expected since the origin of the RCSM was developed and validated for glulam beams in bending during a standard fire [22] (which was developed based on the likely temperatures during flashover of a ventilation-controlled compartment fire). However, from Fig. 8b and c it can be seen that the RCSM estimates a slightly higher retention of bending capacity as the first crosswise layer is charred. This is particularly problematic because it is a reasonable assumption that CLT elements might be stressed to between 10%, for floors and ceilings, and 40%, for compression elements, of their ultimate capacity under the fire limit state loading. The ZSL only affects the crosswise layer, and any deeper thermal penetration is therefore not explicitly accounted for. Prior researchers have commented on this issue, and proposals for improved ZSL formulations specifically for CLT elements have been proposed elsewhere [48,57]. The failure of CLT bending elements in sagging is typically governed by tensile rupture of the most highly stressed timber lamella, and the compression face is unlikely to be significantly heated for simply supported planar CLT slabs. However, the reduction in strength and stiffness of timber is more severe in compression [17]. Because CLT walls are widely used to support gravity loads in multi-storey CLT buildings, it is important to investigate the theoretical crushing resistance of timber elements throughout a burnout fire scenario including the decay phase, particularly for fire-exposed CLT walls without encapsulation. Compressive (crushing) strength is calculated by application of the ultimate compressive strain to the walls and calculation of the resulting stress distribution, both from the temperature gradients or based on the RCSM method (similar to the flexural case above). The results of this analysis are given in Fig. 9, where the concentric axial compressive strength and stiffness reductions in heated timber below the char layer are predicted to play significant roles in further reducing the relative load bearing capacities for more than one hour, from 73% to 62%, after auto-extinction occurs in Experiment Beta1. It is physically impossible for a fixed depth ZSL to account for the continuous thermal wave after the charring halts. Here it must be noted that the ZSL method was never intended to be used in such situations, as it was derived based on simulations to determine capacity and failure in standard fire tests without a decay phase. To imply that a constant ZSL, whether 7 mm or any other fixed value, could account for the decay phase would be incorrect, and it is included here precisely to make this point. It is noteworthy that sudden increases in the relative crushing capacity in Fig. 9b–c are unrealistic and are an artefact of sudden discontinuities in the experimental thermocouple readings. This can occur within the empirical thermal profile data if, for example, a thermocouple becomes damaged and is removed from the analysis, or due to forced extinction by application of water. At a height of 3 m the walls used in these experiments are relatively slender, and instability should therefore be considered in any assessment of their load bearing capacity. The theoretical Euler buckling capacities, for assumed ‘pinned-pinned’ support conditions, during the experiments were calculated by transforming the CLT into an effective cross-section based on the reduced elastic modulus from the temperature distributions and, similar to the calculations above, based on a ZSL in combination with the char depth that was calculated from experimental temperature measurements. It should be noted that the assumed pinned-pinned support conditions were chosen as a ’worst case’ scenario and that, in reality, some rotational stiffness is likely to be available from the connections, from continuity across multiple bays, and from three-dimensional effects. The results of these calculations are shown in Fig. 10 for the three experiments discussed herein. For Experiment Beta1, the Euler buckling capacity closely matches until extinction occurs, after which the continued heating causes a further reduction in buckling resistance, albeit not as significant as the reduction for crushing shown in Fig. 9. For both experiments Beta2 and Gamma1, a reasonable agreement is observed throughout the burning periods aside from a short period in Experiment Beta2 resulting from the effect of the crosswise layer. Compared to the pure crushing capacity shown in Fig. 9, the Euler capacity generally experiences a more severe reduction due to heating; this can be attributed to the increase in effective slenderness as the walls char and heat, which results in a second-order reduction in capacity and should, in the view of the authors, be explicitly accounted for during structural fire analysis of loadbearing timber in compression. It is also noteworthy that the illustrative analysis presented herein assumes the initial (i.e. unloaded) elastic modulus of the cross sections. In reality, the presence of loading may further reduce the theoretical Euler capacity due to the plasticity of timber in compression. Additional research is urgently needed in this area so that rational design guidance can be suggested. In reality, it would be unlikely for either pure crushing or pure Euler buckling to occur in a heated wall element, since the likely asymmetrical heating of a CLT wall (i.e. with heating intended to be confined to a single fire compartment) would cause eccentricities in the loading and subject the cross-section to secondary bending moment effects, thereby increasing the propensity for buckling from secondary bending moments to occur in combination with plastic deformation in the extreme compression fibres. The assessment of the resistance to instability for a semi-plastic cross-section would require knowledge of the deflection history of a particular element. Because the model utilised herein calculates ultimate limit states at a particular cross-section, and does not consider deflection histories, this is outside the scope in the current paper. This ought to be considered in practice however, and research into improved deflection-based failure models for CLT walls is currently underway. The observed temperature redistributions and the associated strength losses described herein are not limited to real fires, but have also been presented in the literature for timber elements heated in standard heating scenarios within fire testing furnaces [12]. Recently presented column fire resistance tests [35] subjected full-scale unloaded glulam columns, with side dimensions of 405 and 460 mm and a heights of 2100 mm, to 90 min of standard [12] fire exposure inside a fire testing furnace, before turning the furnace off and removing the furnace ceiling elements to allow for rapid cooling of the surrounding gas phase. The recorded temperatures were measured by plate thermometers inside the furnace and dropped from approximately 1000 °C to 300 °C in 33 min [35]. Full details of this experimental series (which was performed and reported by others) are not given here. However, in the context of the current discussion it is noteworthy that the reported temperature development through the depth of the columns can be used to analyse the theoretical loss of loadbearing capacity in a similar manner to the calculations for the crushing capacity of the CLT walls described above. For glulam columns it was assumed that heating and charring are symmetrical on all sides. The resulting loss of crushing capacity, using calculations essentially identical to those described previously for CLT walls, however in this case with heating from all four sides, is shown in Fig. 11. It can be seen that the charring rate reduces slightly after the furnace is switched off – likely because the furnace floor and walls continue to radiate significantly even after the furnace burners are turned off and the ceiling removed – and eventually the char depth remains stationary. However, the predicted crushing capacity of the column continues to decrease, from 45% when the furnace is turned off down to 13% of its original value over a period of 2–3 h following the end of the heating phase. This is in part due to the continued charring, but more importantly due to continued heating from propagation of the thermal wave after the charring effectively stops. From a structural fire engineering perspective, it is self-evident that collapse will eventually occur if no extinction occurs, as suggested by experiments Beta2 and Gamma1 discussed previously. Self-extinguishment is therefore considered critical for CLT buildings, for life safety in many cases and for property protection in all cases. As already noted, the furnace testing was originally conceived as a comparative assessment method for structural elements exposed to real compartment fires, and was linked to real fire scenarios based on expected fuel loads and a fundamental desire that structures should maintain their loadbearing function until burnout of all movable fuel [58] (notably including internal linings and combustible finishes). In the compartment fire experiments described herein, the initial fuel load, consisting of wood cribs, was deliberately designed as the minimum required to generate post-flashover conditions, with an intentionally short period of pseudo-steady ventilation-controlled burning. In a real fire, the burning duration may be longer, since higher compartment fuel loads can generally be expected in reality, and the thermal penetration depths could therefore be greater and have more severe consequences. This will depend on the amount of fuel in the compartment, but also on the type of fuel, the ventilation, and the fuel and compartment geometries. This also highlights the need to achieve auto-extinction in compartments where timber surfaces are exposed, or could reasonably be expected to become exposed, prior to burnout occurring. Ambient design typically assumes a simplified stress distribution to consider the load bearing capacity of timber members in bending. Due to the temperature redistributions shown in Figs. 3 and 5, the stress distribution in timber during the decay phase of a fire can differ considerably from what is assumed by the simplified bending strength assumptions. The RCSM also simplifies design through a zero-strength layer and the subsequent treatment of the effective section as at ambient temperature. Under complex stress distributions to be expected in a decay phase such as that observed in Beta1, these two simplifications cannot be reconciled, and more rational design explicitly accounting for these effects should be undertaken. The merit of the RCSM is its simplicity for use in predicting response under standard heating scenarios. It enables designers to quickly perform calculations to assess the standard fire resistance of timber members. However, with a recent increase of interest in CLT, the original concept for the ZSL has increasingly been challenged [25–27,57] within the research community. The widespread application of the fire resistance concept as a framework for relative assessment of safety means that the accompanying verification methods, like the RCSM, have simple, binary outcomes in the form of either pass or fail of a fire resistance rating. This prevents engineers and researchers from confidently optimising laminated timber products during design with fire safety in mind. The simplified analysis presented herein suggests that data are lacking as regards the structural assessment of mass timber elements under realistic heating (and post-heating decay) scenarios. Few data sets are available on strength and stiffness recovery of timber upon cooling. Knudson and Schniewind [60] suggested that timber heated to temperatures below 200 °C would increase in strength when reconditioned (i.e. when stored to reinstate a 12% moisture content). However, this same study also postulated that the elastic modulus is unaffected by heat; this contradicts all other studies in the field. The recommended data (used herein) on the loss of mechanical properties upon heating are – strictly speaking – only valid for standard heating exposures [17], and all available data are derived from tests on individual timber boards rather than laminated timber systems. The actual mechanical response on heating for glulam or CLT could change if, for instance, the bond strength of the adhesives is affected. Additional research is also needed in this area. A potential further consequence of deeper heated depths in the decay phase is weakening of the glue line and the possibility of debonding of char/lamella fall off occurring for engineered timber products. Debonding, other than char fall-off, occurs when the two adhering surfaces are timber and neither has charred completely. For standard fire resistance tests, the temperature gradient in the timber is assumed to be sufficiently steep so as to ensure that glue line temperatures are sufficiently low that debonding or loss of composite action can be avoided before charring of the affected timber occurs [61]. However, for prolonged heating with lower heat fluxes and shallow temperature gradients (e.g. during a decay phase) it has been shown from lap shear elevated temperature bond experiments that debonding may occur as a failure mode [62]; it has also been shown that local debonding can cause stress concentrations, and that these could develop into rolling shear failures [63]. A bond line temperature of 150 °C has been identified as critical by Craft for the weakening of PUR adhesives [64], however different formulations of adhesives can show considerable variation in thermal performance [65]. Additional research is also needed in this area. In depth temperatures of CLT elements in full-scale compartment fire experiments have been analysed and the theoretical reductions in load bearing capacity of exposed ceiling and wall elements predicted for illustrative purposes in this paper. It has been shown that the load bearing capacity of CLT walls and slabs can be expected to continue to reduce, to differing degrees, during the decay phase of a burnout fire. This occurs even after auto-extinction has been achieved and charring has ceased and is attributed to the continued propagation of a thermal wave beneath the char layer during the decay phase. This effect has also been shown to apply to glulam columns tested by others [35]. For simply-supported flexural elements heated from below the redistribution of temperatures does not appear to result in significant loss of capacity during the decay phase. Comparisons have been provided for the theoretical load bearing capacity reductions between a cross sectional analysis model, which accounts for the actual temperature profiles in the timber and the resulting reduction in mechanical properties of the timber layers, versus a conventional RCSM model using a constant zero strength layer depth of 7 mm and the experimentally obtained charring rates. For slabs in bending, it was found that the initial reduction in the ultimate moments agreed well between the two analysis approaches; this was, however, not the case once the weak cross-layers charred, as expected based on prior work by others [27]. The results presented in the current paper, and the accompanying theoretical considerations for the reduction in structural capacity, suggest that, for timber compartments with significant amounts of exposed timber structural elements, the fire dynamics and the thermal and structural response are closely interlinked and cannot be considered separately – as is explicitly done within the traditional structure fire resistance design framework that has been historically deployed for use with non-combustible structural systems (i.e. concrete and steel structures, or encapsulated timber). The conventional fire resistance framework, where structural safety in case of fire is provided essentially as a relative measure, cannot provide suitable means by which to optimise innovative laminated timber products, and also hinders the application of structural fire safety engineering as part of a holistic fire safety design approach in tall, engineered mass timber buildings. A lack of data on the reduction in strength and elastic modulus for heated timber has been identified, especially since all existing data originated from solid timber boards and may not be fully applicable to laminated timber products including CLT and glulam. Research into the mechanical properties of heated, uncharred laminated timber is therefore urgently needed. Likewise, a lack of data on the residual strength of timber after being heated introduces uncertainty into the analyses of timber elements during the decay phase after auto-extinction. Where buildings use exposed structural timber and rely on a defend-in-place fire strategy (as would be expected in mid- to high-rise residential timber buildings) designs should normally ensure auto-extinction will occur after the (moveable) fuel load has burnt out. The load bearing capacity of walls and columns will continue to deteriorate after burnout, and currently this is not explicitly accounted for in prescriptive fire resistance design (e.g. based on Table A2 in Approved Document B [66] or 4.1.3.1.2.1 in NFPA 5000 [67]). Designers of timber buildings, and especially of tall timber buildings, should therefore consider the decay phase when specifying required member dimensions to maintain load bearing capacity during burnout fires. In order to carry out an engineering design of a mass timber building, close cooperation between the structural and fire engineering team will be necessary. Since the fire dynamics and the structural behaviour are interlinked and the heat transfer is more complex than for steel or concrete, the range of potential fires cannot be represented by a single temperature versus time exposure.',\n"," \"The three pathways that contribute to human color vision originate in different retinal combinations of the signals from the long, medium and short-wave sensitive cone photoreceptors (Hurvich and Jameson, 1957; Jameson and Hurvich, 1968). One pathway processes achromatic luminance (L + M), and two are isoluminant chromatic pathways: ‘red vs. green’ (L-M) and ‘yellow vs. blue’ (S-cone isolating). These precortical physiological pathways can also be probed by psychophysical experiments, which demonstrate differences in their spatial frequency tuning profiles (Johnson et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2013; Mullen, 1985; Owsley et al., 1983; Poirson and Wandell, 1993, 1996; Webster et al., 1990). For luminance stimuli, these profiles are band-pass (peak sensitivity ∼4 cycles per degree (cpd)), whereas isoluminant chromatic stimuli functions are typically low-pass (peak sensitivity <1 cpd) (Webster et al., 1990). The nature of simple pre-cortical center/surround receptive field structures means that receptive field size and preferred spatial frequency are correlated. Specifically, linear simple cells with large receptive fields respond to low spatial frequencies and vice versa (Chen et al., 2009; Cleland et al., 1979; Enroth-Cugell and Freeman, 1987; Irvin et al., 1993). However, this relationship ultimately breaks down in visual cortex. For instance, neurons have very large receptive fields in higher visual areas but can, nevertheless, be driven by stimuli with high spatial frequency content (Rajimehr et al., 2011). This non-linearity is typical of complex cells, in which spatial tuning is independent of receptive field sizes (Movshon et al., 1978). Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) allows us to record the average response from groups of neurons inside individual voxels that measure on the order of a cubic millimeter. By fitting the responses of these neuronal populations to simple high contrast achromatic stimuli, Dumoulin and Wandell (2008) showed that it is possible to estimate the population receptive field (pRF) size as well as preferred spatial field location for each voxel in visual cortex. The stimuli used in pRF mapping must activate a subset of all the neurons in each voxel. For example, if the stimuli contain only very low spatial frequencies, they are unlikely to drive responses in neurons tuned to fine details. Similarly, isoluminant stimuli cannot drive neurons that respond only to achromatic contrast. Several groups have performed experiments altering the pRF mapping stimuli along some spatial dimensions (e.g. logarithmically-scaled bar widths, second order orientation, hybrid rings/wedges, and multifocal arc stimuli) and have reported effects on both the quality and the parameters of the resulting pRF models (Alvarez et al., 2015; Binda et al., 2013; Yildirim et al., 2017). However, all groups to date have used black and white 100% contrast carrier patterns. The pRF estimates produced are therefore all necessarily driven by neurons responding to high-contrast achromatic stimuli. Here, we asked whether pRF size estimates change as a function of stimulus chromaticity. Because the spatial frequency sensitivity of isoluminant chromatic pathways is much lower than that of the achromatic pathway, we hypothesized that pRFs measured using isoluminant stimuli would be, on average, larger than those measured using achromatic stimuli - particularly for the S-cone condition, as the sparse density of S-cones in the retina limit the spatial resolution of the S-cone pathway (Williams et al., 1993). This predicted outcome is partly dependent on the type of cells contributing to the population; the hypothesis assumes that we are able to primarily record the activity of populations of linear simple cells within each voxel. However, studies of cat and monkey striate cortex indicate an approximately even split of cells classified into linear and complex cell types (Skottun et al., 1991) while recent work suggests that the distinction between simple and complex cells may be, in part, a function of spiking nonlinearities (Mechler and Ringach, 2002; Priebe et al., 2004) and so responses from both cell classes may be indistinguishable when measured by fMRI which is predominantly sensitive to presynaptic changes in membrane potential (Logothetis, 2000). Therefore, an alternate hypothesis, that accounts for a larger contribution from complex cells, would not predict a difference in pRF sizes between conditions because these cells, as described above, demonstrate little correlation between receptive field size and spatial frequency tuning. We performed two fMRI experiments, and a psychophysical experiment. One fMRI experiment confirmed that we could measure fMRI correlates of variations in spatial sensitivity in the different color channels, using full-field gratings of different spatial frequencies that stimulated each of the three axes from a cone excitation color space (the Macleod-Boynton color space) (MacLeod and Boynton, 1979). We performed the psychophysical experiment to measure contrast sensitivity functions for each of the conditions, using spatial 2-alternative-forced-choice (2AFC) tasks. The resulting functions agreed with previous behavioral measurements of spatial frequency tuning between these channels. Finally, we conducted pRF mapping with fMRI using spatially broadband carriers that stimulated the same, isolated axes in Macleod-Boynton color space, to ask whether we could measure systematic effects of chromaticity on pRF sizes across the visual field. Although we measured robust pRFs at all eccentricities and the size of these pRFs changed consistently with both eccentricity and visual area (in line with previous studies), no significant effects of chromaticity were observed in the pRF data. We discuss these findings in relation to early work on complex cell receptive field size and spatial frequency tuning. Six color-normal trichromats (two female) with a mean age of 28.7 years (±8.1 years) were recruited for this study. All subjects had previously taken part in retinotopic fMRI scans, and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Five of these subjects took part in the spatial sensitivity fMRI and psychophysical studies (two female, mean age 28 years (±8.9 years)), and all six subjects took part in the pRF study. The ethics committees at the York Neuroimaging Centre and the Department of Psychology at the University of York approved these experiments. The stimuli used in these experiments were designed and presented using Psykinematix software (KyberVision, Montreal, Canada: psykinematix.com) on an Apple Mac computer (Apple computers, USA). The delivery system used for the visual stimulus in the scanner was an Epson EB-G5900 projector with a long throw lens, which projected the stimulus onto a custom-made acrylic screen. The participant viewed the screen with a mirror set-up in the scanner. For the psychophysical tasks, the subjects viewed the stimulus on a NEC MultiSync 200 CRT monitor, running at 100Hz. For both displays, gamma correction was performed using a ‘Spyder4’ (Datacolor, NJ, USA) display calibrator. The same calibrator was used to measure the color properties of the RGB guns on the CRT monitor, whereas spectral measurements of the scanner screen RGB channels were made through the viewing mirror using a ‘Jaz’ (Ocean Optics, FL) photospectrometer at 2 nm resolution and imported into Psykinematix. To ensure the chromatic stimuli were isoluminant for each subject, minimum motion isoluminance tasks were carried out while inside the scanner, so that the stimuli could be specifically tailored for each subject's isoluminant point. Subjects fixated centrally while adjusting the color of a drifting grating that was placed in their lower left periphery. The grating had a 2° radius, centered at an eccentricity of 7° from the fixation point, with a drift rate of 1°/s and spatial frequency of 1 cpd. The point at which the drifting motion was minimized was chosen to reflect the isoluminant point of the stimulus (Anstis and Cavanagh, 1983). The color direction of the grating was specified within the Psykinematix software using LMS values in MacLeod-Boynton color space (MacLeod and Boynton, 1979), using the 2° cone fundamentals from Stockman and Sharpe (2000). The RMS (root mean square) contrasts used for the stimuli in the isoluminance tasks matched those used in the spatial sensitivity and pRF fMRI experiments for the same conditions: L-M = 4%, S-cone = 15%. These contrast values approximately equalize responses in primary visual cortex (Kane et al., 2011), and were calculated as 3× the average contrast detection levels measured using a spatial 4-alternative-forced-choice (4AFC) method, with circular (2° diameter) white noise stimuli placed at 7° eccentricity from the central fixation mark; the luminance contrast threshold acquired with the same method yielded a 5% contrast. Three repeats of the isoluminance adjustments were made, and the average of these values was used. Subjects practiced these minimum motion tasks outside the scanner in the laboratory (on the calibrated CRT monitor) prior to performing them in the scanner. In all cases, isoluminant directions were very close to those predicted by the nominal MacLeod-Boynton axes. The stimuli used in the spatial sensitivity experiment were sinusoidal gratings presented within a circular window (radius 10°) with one of three spatial frequencies (0.5, 2 and 8 cpd). Orientation was randomized and contrast polarity was reversed at a temporal frequency of 2Hz (see examples in Fig. 1). For all subjects, the RMS cone contrast levels of the Luminance, L-M and S-cone stimuli were set to 5%, 4% and 15% respectively, as used in the isoluminance tasks described above. Subjects fixated centrally throughout, and performed a demanding attentional task (button press when the fixation cross changed) that was not locked to the timing of the grating. An event-related design was used to present the stimuli from each event condition; there were a total of 10 events (3 spatial frequencies for 3 conditions, plus one blank condition). Each event was presented for 3 s (1 TR) with a randomized inter-stimulus interval length of between 3 and 6.5 s. Each event was presented four times in a complete scan, with all events presented in a randomized order. A total of four scans were completed for each subject, which resulted in 16 trials for each event condition. Contrast detection thresholds were measured for each color condition (luminance, L-M, and S-cone isolating) at each of the spatial frequencies used in the spatial sensitivity fMRI experiment. A spatial 2AFC method was used with a Bayesian staircase procedure (Kontsevich and Tyler, 1999) to obtain 75% correct detection thresholds. The task was performed at two eccentricities: 2° and 8° (horizontally from fixation to the center of each grating). Thresholds were determined for each condition in separate blocks of trials. Stimuli were circularly-windowed sine-wave gratings (2° diameter), and trial locations were outlined with thin white circles to remove spatial uncertainty. A total of 200 trials (presented for 100 ms) were carried out for each eccentricity and spatial frequency combination plus 10 practice trials of each, which were not included in the analysis. For each of the chromatic conditions, minimum motion tasks similar to those described for the fMRI experiments were carried out first to set the isoluminance levels for each eccentricity and observer. The stimuli for each condition in the pRF experiment matched the spatial sensitivity stimuli in contrast, isoluminance values used, total eccentricity (20° diameter), and temporal frequency (2Hz). A bar stimulus similar in general form to those described in other experiments (Alvarez et al., 2015; Binda et al., 2013; Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008) was used; a single bar (width 0.5°) within a circular aperture (10° radius) moved in one of eight directions with each ‘sweep’ across the field lasting 48 s. Four periods of mean luminance were included to provide a baseline condition within each scan, these periods always occurred in the second half of diagonal bar sweeps and lasted 24 s (see Fig. 2). Subjects carried out a maximum of four scans of each condition over two or three sessions. To equalize spatial frequency power across the spectrum, carriers consisted of a white noise pattern that updated at 2Hz; examples of the pRF stimuli used in each condition can be seen in Fig. 3. In Appendix A, we illustrate the representation of this stimulus in the Fourier domain: the windowed white noise generates a smooth spread of power in the spatial frequency domain. The effect of increasing bar width is to slightly increase the overall power of the stimulus in Fourier space but it has no effect on the relative distribution of frequency components. To help the subjects maintain central fixation, the same attentional task from the spatial sensitivity experiment was used. fMRI scans were carried out using a GE 3 T HDx Excite MRI scanner, with a 16-channel posterior surface coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA) covering the occipital pole. The subject's head was positioned in the coil mount and surrounded by foam padding and a forehead strap to ensure the head was stable and that the subject was comfortable. Scan slices were aligned to cover the region containing and surrounding the calcarine sulcus (the anatomical region containing the primary visual cortex). A total of 39 EPI slices were taken within an FOV of 192 × 192 mm2, with 2 mm3 isotropic voxels (TR = 3000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, acquisition/reconstruction matrix = 96 × 96). Four ‘dummy’ TRs (12 s) were included at the beginning of each scan to allow the signal to reach magnetic equilibrium. In addition to the functional scans, a proton density (PD) scan with the same spatial prescription as the EPI data was acquired at the beginning of each session – this scan was used to align the fMRI data to a high-resolution (1 x 1 x 1mm) T1-weighted structural scan of the full brain acquired prior to the fMRI sessions in the same GE 3 T HDx Excite MRI scanner, using an 8-channel surface coil to minimize magnetic field inhomogeneity. All functional data processing was performed using the 2015 version of the VISTA software (https://web.stanford.edu/group/vista/cgi-bin/wiki/index.php/Software) (Vista Lab, Stanford University), running under MATLAB 2012a (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). fMRI scan data were imported and motion corrected between and within scans from each session using a maximum likelihood alignment routine (Nestares and Heeger, 2000). T1-weighted high resolution scans were used to reconstruct a structural model of each subject's brain using a combination of FSL (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/) (Smith et al., 2004), Freesurfer (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) (Dale et al., 1999; Reuter et al., 2012) and the VISTA software. The functional scans were aligned to the anatomical structural image using the PD scan acquired at the beginning of the functional scan session. Alignments were checked for accuracy by visual inspection and minor adjustments were made using manually-placed control points. After the functional scans from each session were aligned to these high-resolution anatomies, analyses were confined to the segmented cortical gray matter sheet (Wandell et al., 2000). Regions of interest (ROIs) of early visual areas V1 through to V4 were identified using the retinotopic output of the pRF modelling (described below). Further ROIs were created within each visual area, to produce two eccentricity group levels - foveal (<2° visual angle) and peripheral (between 8° and 10° visual angle). The same ROIs were used to analyze both the spatial sensitivity data and the pRF data. pRF sizes and positions were estimated for each voxel and chromaticity condition using the standard pRF modelling algorithm described by Dumoulin and Wandell (2008) and implemented with the 2015 VISTA software tools. Modelling was performed on time series data averaged across all repetitions of the same chromaticity condition using a standard ‘difference of gammas’ hemodynamic response function (HRF) from the SPM analysis package (Friston et al., 2006). The final pRF estimates only include voxels that have at least 10% of the variance explained by the model fit. We also applied pRF modelling to a grand average of all scans (i.e. across all chromatic and luminance conditions); the retinotopic eccentricities and polar angles from these grand averages were used to estimate the boundaries of the early visual areas (V1-V4). These regions of interest (ROIs), marking each individual's early visual areas, were drawn by hand on a flattened representation of the cortical surface and checked by at least one other expert observer, see Fig. 4 for an example from one subject. Retinotopic maps produced by each chromatic condition show essentially identical visual area boundaries (as shown in Fig. 5, for the same subject), and therefore the same grand average ROIs were used for all conditions within each subject. The foveal and peripheral eccentricity ROIs were created by restricting the data within each visual area for the desired visual angles, using the eccentricity values from the model. Event-related data were analyzed using a general linear model (GLM) within the VISTA software tools. The beta weights for each condition were extracted for each subject for each event, and group averages were produced for the ROIs described above. For each color condition, the responses to the 8 cpd spatial frequency stimuli were particularly low and subjects reported that these stimuli were very hard to see – possibly due to limitations in the resolution of the scanner stimulus display. Therefore, only the 0.5 and 2 cpd conditions were used to measure spatial sensitivity. The difference in signal response between these two conditions was calculated to produce a single value, referred to here as spatial sensitivity. Negative values indicated a greater sensitivity to lower spatial frequencies, whereas positive values indicated greater sensitivity to higher spatial frequencies. For each subject, and within each ROI for each condition, the 2 cpd and 0.5 cpd beta values were first normalized to the peak response out of the two spatial frequencies and then the difference between the normalized values was calculated (see Equation (1)). Fig. 6 shows the psychophysical contrast sensitivity functions for each condition (Luminance, L-M, and S-cone isolating) at two eccentricities (2° and 8°); values are the means across subjects with standard error bars. For both eccentricities, the chromatic conditions show low-pass sensitivity functions, whereas the luminance condition shows peak sensitivity at the middle spatial frequency value (2 cpd). Between eccentricities, lower contrast sensitivities are observed as a function of eccentricity, with the L-M condition showing the greatest overall difference between the 2° and 8° conditions. Factors of eccentricity, condition, and spatial frequency were entered into a repeated-measures ANOVA to identify the effect of each on the contrast sensitivity values; significant main effects were found for each factor (eccentricity (F(1,4) = 179.921, p = 10−4), condition (F(2,8) = 78.730, p = 10−6), and spatial frequency (F(2,8) = 153.965, p = 10−6)). Each of these observations have been reported by many other groups (Mullen, 1985; Mullen and Kingdom, 2002; Rovamo et al., 1999; Webster et al., 1990), and, in particular, they support the assertion that psychophysically-defined S-cone isolating pathways have low spatial sensitivity. They also serve as a useful validation of our stimulus generation and presentation pathway: significant errors in, for example, our calibration procedures would have led to luminance contamination of our nominally-isoluminant stimuli and a corresponding increase in similarity between the luminance and isoluminant spatial sensitivity functions. The spatial sensitivity data were analyzed using the foveal and peripheral eccentricity ROIs for each visual area, these data are plotted in Fig. 7. A repeated-measures ANOVA was carried out using factors of visual area, eccentricity and condition, to determine any effect on spatial sensitivity (the difference between responses to the 2 and 0.5 cpd spatial frequencies). Mauchly's test of Sphericity was violated only for the interaction between eccentricity and visual area (χ2(5) = 12.243, p = 0.042), therefore a Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied to the results of this interaction. There was a significant effect of eccentricity (F(1,4) = 78.636, p = 0.001), and visual area (F(3,12) = 11.110, p = 0.001), but no significant main effect of condition (F(2,8) = 0.655, p = 0.545). However, all interactions were shown to be significant: eccentricity and visual area (F(1.682,6.726) = 8.375, p = 0.017, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected), eccentricity and condition (F(2,8) = 4.682, p = 0.045), condition and visual area (F(6,24) = 6.330, p = 0.0004), and the interaction between all factors (F(6,24) = 3.805, p = 0.008). Visual observation of the data indicate that the significant interactions may primarily be driven by the peripheral S-cone condition. To explore this further, paired comparisons were made between each of the conditions at each eccentricity, within area V1; paired t-tests were carried out between the conditions within each eccentricity (i.e. six comparisons, reducing the significance criteria with Bonferroni correction to 0.008). The S-cone condition did significantly differ from both the L-M condition (t(4) = −8.002, p = 0.001) and the luminance condition (t(4) = −5.793, p = 0.004), within the peripheral eccentricity. No other condition pairs reached significance. pRF sizes for each chromatic condition are plotted as a function of eccentricity in Fig. 8, and are separated by visual area (see figure legend). For all conditions, increases in pRF sizes can be observed as a function of both eccentricity and visual area. As with the spatial sensitivity data, the data were analyzed using the foveal and peripheral eccentricity ROIs for each visual area, plotted in Fig. 9, using a repeated-measures ANOVA with factors of visual area, eccentricity and condition. Mauchly's test of Sphericity was violated for the visual areas factor (χ2(5) = 15.695, p = 0.010), and therefore a Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied prior to the interpretation of the visual area factor and associated interactions where Mauchly's test could not be run (i.e. three-way interaction and the interaction with condition). In line with the observations made from the plotted data in Fig. 8, highly significant effects were observed for the factors of eccentricity (F(1,5) = 2458.257, p = 10−7), and visual area (F(1.574,7.871) = 107.981, p = 10−5, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected), and a significant interaction was found between these two factors (F(3,15) = 85.102, p = 10−8). However, no significant effect of condition was observed (F(2,10) = 2.37, p = 0.144), and no significant interactions with the condition factor were found: condition and visual area (F(2.580,12.899) = 1.253, p = 0.327, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected), condition and eccentricity (F(2,10) = 1.905, p = 0.199), or for the three-way interaction between all factors (F(1.765,8.825) = 1.675, p = 0.241, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected). In contrast to the significant paired comparisons shown for the spatial sensitivity data in area V1 (see Statistical analysis section ‘Spatial sensitivity’), for the pRF data no significant differences were found between any of the condition pairs at either the foveal or peripheral eccentricities. Both sets of V1 data are shown side-by-side in Fig. 10. We also implemented a Compressive Spatial Summation (CSS) pRF model (Kay et al., 2013) on our data. This has been shown to account for more of the variance in the fMRI signal than the original linear pRF model (Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008). However, in the visual areas we analyzed (V1-V4) we did not find a significant difference in the amount of variance explained within each condition by the CSS model compared to the original pRF model (using paired t-tests, and Bonferroni correction). Furthermore, this model did not produce any differences in the pRF size estimates (the results of a repeated-measures ANOVA found the same overall effects and interactions as reported above). The detailed output of this model is reported in Appendix B. It is possible that between voxels there is variability in the number of neurons preferentially responsive to each condition, which may bias the mean pRF size produced for each voxel. Therefore, in order to control for any such bias, we repeated the analysis using different voxels for each condition, namely those that preferentially responded to each condition, as determined by the amount of variance explained by each of the conditions. For instance, the voxels that were used for the luminance condition in this analysis were those that had a greater amount of the variance explained than either the L-M or S-cone conditions. A repeated-measures ANOVA showed no main effect of condition (F(2,10) = 2.335, p = 0.147), while there were significant main effects of eccentricity (F(1,5) = 311.016, p = 10−4) and visual area (F(3,15) = 51.741, p = 10−7), and a significant interaction between these two factors (F(3,15) = 42.875, p = 10−6). In this analysis, a significant interaction was also observed between condition and eccentricity (F(2,10) = 11.963, p = 0.002), however, the three-way interaction between all factors remained insignificant (F(6,30) = 1.165, p = 0.351), as was the interaction between condition and visual area (F(6,30) = 1.442, p = 0.232). Paired comparisons between conditions for foveal and peripheral eccentricities within V1 showed no significant differences between any of the pairings, in agreement with the original analysis. We measured pRF sizes using isoluminant chromatic stimuli that confine responses to a limited set of pre-cortical pathways – an experiment suggested by Dumoulin and Wandell (2008) in the first paper to introduce this fMRI technique. We asked whether cortical neuronal populations tuned to isoluminant color directions have larger average receptive field sizes than those driven predominantly by achromatic patterns. We used fMRI to measure pRF sizes and spatial frequency sensitivity across eccentricities and visual areas (V1 to V4) and found no effect of chromatic condition on pRF sizes: pRF sizes increased systematically across all conditions, with an identical increase in size as a function of both eccentricity and visual area. Conversely, we did observe differences in spatial frequency sensitivity between conditions. Specifically, the S-cone isolating condition showed a significantly greater sensitivity to lower spatial frequencies than either the luminance or L-M conditions in the more peripheral location. Typical contrast sensitivity functions (CSFs), acquired behaviorally, show that S-cone isolating stimuli produce low-pass CSFs, and an achromatic luminance stimulus produces a band-pass CSF, which peaks in sensitivity at approximately 4 cpd in the fovea (Mullen, 1985; Webster et al., 1990). We also replicated these findings here, at both 2° and 8° eccentricities, using the same subjects from the fMRI experiments. In our fMRI spatial sensitivity experiment, all conditions showed greater sensitivity to higher spatial frequencies in the fovea (2 cpd > 0.5 cpd), and greater sensitivity to lower spatial frequencies in the periphery (0.5 cpd > 2 cpd). In the periphery, our data showed significantly greater low-pass-type responses for the S-cone isolating stimuli compared to both the luminance and the L-M conditions; the L-M condition did not significantly differ from the luminance condition in spatial sensitivity. Psychophysical experiments are often used to estimate features of the underlying physiology. However, our psychophysical data do not match the fMRI data from our spatial sensitivity experiment directly. This may be due to several aspects of the stimuli that differ between the experiments. For instance, psychophysical studies often operate at detection or discrimination thresholds (low contrast differences and short stimulus durations), whereas stimuli in fMRI studies are presented at suprathreshold contrast levels for longer periods (∼3 s). These above-threshold contrasts may simply drive more neurons and broaden the population-level tuning curves compared to threshold level responses. Suprathreshold stimuli may also drive some neuronal populations to saturation, flattening population tuning curves and reducing the effective response differences between chromatic channels. We note, for example, that Poirson and Wandell (1993) estimate that the SF tuning of neuronal chromatic channels measured in suprathrehsold experiments may be far more similar than behavioral responses suggest because much of the high spatial frequency power is removed by optical factors. Another way of viewing this observation is that cortex may have relatively large populations of S-cone-driven cells sensitive to high spatial frequencies (and perhaps with relatively small RFs) but that these are invisible at low contrasts because axial chromatic blur will remove the stimulus features that drive them. At high contrast, there may be enough residual power at high spatial frequency to elicit a response from this population. One way to address this issue would be to perform pRF mapping using threshold-level stimuli. Given sufficient SNR (signal to noise ratio) or a long-enough recording session, responses driven by threshold-level differences can be measured (Ress and Heeger, 2003), and it might, in principle, be possible to perform pRF mapping experiments in this manner, but this is beyond the scope of our study. Nevertheless, our data are in broad agreement with recent fMRI studies of spatial frequency tuning. For instance, Henriksson et al. (2008) show that for achromatic stimuli the mean spatial frequency preferences of voxels decreased both with ascending visual area (from V1 to V3A) and with increasing eccentricity. Both of these effects are observed in our data. More recently, D'Souza et al. (2016) found the same decrease in spatial frequency tuning with increased eccentricity within V1, for both achromatic and chromatic (L-M and S-cone isolating) stimuli. In line with our findings, D'Souza et al. found that responses in foveal V1 demonstrated band-pass responses for all pathways, with the luminance stimuli producing smaller responses than the chromatic conditions for the lower spatial frequencies (our data showed a non-significant trend in this direction). Additionally, at a peripheral eccentricity of 9.8°, responses to S-cone stimuli decreased more rapidly with increasing spatial frequency than either the luminance or L-M conditions. This result is consistent with our finding that the relative spatial sensitivity in the S-cone condition was significantly lower than both luminance and L-M conditions at peripheral eccentricities in V1. The pRF technique does appear to reflect the receptive field sizes of the underlying neuronal population: previous fMRI pRF studies using achromatic stimuli (Alvarez et al., 2015; Binda et al., 2013; Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008) reported an increase in pRF sizes as a function of eccentricity, which agrees with other single-cell (Gattass et al., 1987; Van Essen, Newsome and Maunsell, 1984) and 2-deoxyglucose uptake measurements (Tootell et al., 1988) and our spatial sensitivity data are surprisingly similar to those noted by earlier attempts to measure chromatic and achromatic population receptive fields using multiunit recordings (Victor et al., 1994). The increase in pRF size with eccentricity also mirrors the negative correlations reported between eccentricity and spatial frequency sensitivity (Cleland et al., 1979; Foster et al., 1985; Schiller et al., 1976; Troy, 1983). We consider two possible explanations for the apparent invariance in pRF sizes between chromatic and achromatic conditions in our data. One possibility is that our pRF measurements may not be sensitive enough to detect differences between the chromatic stimulus conditions. However, this explanation seems unlikely, given the reliability of our data and the fact that our measurements are able to track the eccentricity-dependent changes in pRF sizes, which are consistent with changes in spatial frequency tuning across eccentricities seen for both luminance and isoluminant systems. Likewise, anticipated changes in pRF sizes are observed across visual areas. If the S-cone system had scaled pRF sizes consistently with spatial frequency sensitivity, we would expect to find a difference between pRF sizes for luminance and S-cone values; if we use our spatial sensitivity data to predict the pRF sizes (as described above), we could expect an increase of at least a factor of 1.3 in the S-cone condition. This change in pRF sizes should be clearly detectable given the sensitivity of our data. Alternatively, there may be no difference in average pRF sizes between luminance and chromatic pathways in visual cortex. While the correlation between spatial frequency tuning and receptive field size is mandatory in simple cell receptive fields, early work on complex cell receptive field structure by Movshon et al. (1978), demonstrated that this relationship breaks down for complex cells: the spatial tuning of complex cells is independent of their receptive field sizes. As demonstrated in several fMRI studies, including our own, clear differences in spatial frequency tuning can be observed across eccentricities, visual areas, and between achromatic and chromatic pathways (D'Souza et al., 2016; Henriksson et al., 2008). However, these differences in spatial sensitivity need not be coupled with receptive field sizes if they reflect responses dominated by complex cells – perhaps because our stimuli could, potentially, drive second order contrast detection mechanisms, which have recently been shown to support pRF mapping in early visual areas (Yildirim et al., 2017), as well as first-order luminance contrast detectors. It is also possible that, for some reason, complex cells contribute proportionately more fMRI signal, and therefore mask sub-populations of linear simple cells that are tuned to spatial frequency as a function of receptive field size. We also note that the spatial frequency/size prediction for L-M isoluminant stimuli is far less clear. Many so-called color-luminance cells respond to both L-M and Luminance contrast and most of these are sensitive to spatial structure (Johnson et al., 2004). Although our behavioral data suggest reduced spatial frequency sensitivity in the neurons tuned to L-M contrast at threshold, once our stimulus contrast was increased to generate a reliable BOLD response, it is possible that we stimulated a population of color-luminance neurons that may have responded to both L-M and achromatic contrast in a similar manner. Likewise, it has been shown that some neurons within V1 also represent combinations of the S-cone pathway with both L-M and luminance pathways (De Valois et al, 2000), and therefore responses from these cells may also be similar across all conditions. To summarize, we used the same stimulus parameters (contrast, isoluminance, temporal frequency) to measure spatial frequency sensitivity and pRF sizes of neurons driven by the luminance, L-M and S-cone isolating pathways. Effects of chromatic condition were observed for the spatial sensitivity manipulation, with S-cone isolating stimuli producing significantly lower spatial sensitivity indices than either the luminance or L-M conditions in the peripheral areas of V1. No effects of chromaticity were observed in the pRF data. We conclude that the invariance observed in pRF measurements was a result of an actual invariance in population-average receptive field sizes between these pathways. We suggest that this may be due to the prevalence of color-luminance cells as well as the presence of complex, pattern-sensitive cells in the visual cortex, which do not demonstrate a linear relationship between receptive field size and spatial sensitivity.\",\n"," 'Secreted proteins were extracted from the conditioned medium of one pair of the fibroblast cultures. We performed a proteomic analysis of the proteins using a Synapt G1 mass spectrometer. The mass data interpretation was performed using ProteinLynx Global Server, X! Tandem and Scaffold softwares. The proteomic data presented here include the protein and spectrum identification results, as well as the cellular component annotation and functional analyzing results. 227 proteins were identified with a false discovery rate of 1.3% based on 15,000 assigned spectra. Half of the proteins were novel identifications in the secretome of colonic fibroblasts comparing with the known report. The subcellular localization of the identified proteins were annotated using UniProt database, DAVID, SignalP, SecretomeP, Phobius, WoLF PSORT and exosome databases. The occurrence of the fibroblast secretome proteins in the colon cancer cell proteomes was also analyzed. The functional enrichment of the identified proteins was performed using DAVID. We established two pairs of colon cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and normal fibroblast (NF) cultures. The fresh colorectal cancer tissues and adjacent normal colonic tissues (at least 5 cm away from the loci of cancerous tissue) from two patients with colon ulcerated adenocarcinoma were collected during surgery at the Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University according to the procedure described in the Journal of Proteomics paper [1]. The clinic and pathological data of the two patients are available in Supplementary Table 1. Fifty micro gram of the SP extracted from the 1031_NF and 1031_CAF conditioned medium (CM) were separated using 10% SDS-PAGE. Equal amount of sample was loaded in triplicate. Two gel lanes of each sample were cut into 10 slices separately and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion according to an optimized procedure [2]. The digested peptides were analyzed using Synapt G1 mass spectrometer as described previously [3]. Briefly, the peptide mixture from each gel slice was first loaded onto a reverse phase (RP) trap column (C18, 5 μm, 180 μm×20-mm Symmetry C18 nanoAcquity column, Waters) for on-line desalting at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. The peptides were then eluted from the trap column into an analytical fused silica nanoAcquity UPLC column of 75 μm×200-mm inner diameter packed with C18 of 1.7-μm pore diameter stationary phase (Waters). The column oven temperature was maintained at 40 °C. Mobile phase A contains 0.1% formic acid (FA) in water, while mobile phase B was 100% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.1% FA. The mobile phases were delivered using a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters) at a flow rate of 250 nL/min. The peptides were separated with a linear gradient of 3–15% mobile phase B (5 min), 15–35% B (65 min), 35–98% B (5 min), 98% B (5 min), and 98–3% B (10 min). The peptides were ionized at the end of a 10-μm-inner diameter PicoTip nanospray emitter (New Objective) which was connected to the end of the analytical column. A voltage of 3200 V was applied to the emitter for a steady spray. The ions got into a Synapt G1 mass spectrometer (Waters) via a Nano electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The source-inside temperature was maintained at 100 °C. During the data acquisition, a reference sprayer using 320 fmol/μL lock mass compound [Glu1]-fibrinopeptide B (GFB) (Sigma) was sampled with a frequency of 30 s at a flow rate of 200 nL/min. The precision of the mass data was calibrated using the doubly charged monoisotopic ion of GFB. The MSE data was acquired using alternating low-energy collision at 6 eV for survey scan and high-energy collision ramped from 15 to 55 eV for tandem MS. The spectral acquisition time in each mode of 1.2 s and a full cycle was 2.44 s. The mass range of the survey scan was set at m/z 100 to 1800. ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS) v2.5 (Waters) was used for peak picking and DB searching as described previously [3]. The searching DB contains 20,273 human protein entries extracted from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Release 2014_01. The DB searching result files in zip format were exported from PLGS using a Scaffold plugin and were parsed into Scaffold v4.2.1 (Proteome Software, Inc.). For data integration and validation by Scaffold, the standard legacy PeptideProphet scoring system [4] and the standard experiment wide protein grouping method were adopted. An integrated version of X! Tandem (Version: CYCLONE (2010.12.01.1)) in Scaffold was used for an additional DB searching using the same parameters as PLGS. The searching results from both PLGS and X! Tandem were combined automatically by Scaffold. Protein identifications were accepted with a protein probability >99.0% assigned by ProteinProphet [5] and ≥3 unique peptides of <0.1% false positive rate (FDR) assigned by PeptideProphet algorithm [4]. The protein abundance was represented by the exclusive spectrum count which was normalized across different samples. Supplementary Table 2 contains the proteomic analysis and the bioinformatics analysis results of the identified proteins. The table lists the protein name, gene name, gene symbol and molecular weight. The proteomic data include the exclusive spectrum count, exclusive unique peptide count, percent coverage, exclusive unique spectrum count and the total spectrum count. These results were output from Scaffold. The subcellular localization analysis results include the information or prediction from UniProt, SignalP, Phobius, SecretomeP, WoLF PSORT, DAVID, ExoCarts and Vesiclepedia. Based on these analyses, a final annotation was made manually. Tissue specificity gene expression enrichment was analyzed using the Gene Enrichment Profiler and a smooth muscle-enriched expression might indicate the characteristics of myofibroblast. A comparison to the identification results of De Boeck et al.׳s was made [6]. We also compared the identified fibroblast protein with known colon cancer proteins reported by 10 articles. The first paper by Meike et al. analyzed the expressions of colon cancer cell lines Caco-2, HT-29, HCT-116, SW480, SW1398 and identified 2361 proteins [7]. The other papers containing colon cancer cell identifications are listed in Table 1. The GO analysis results, including the biological process, cellular component and molecular function, were generated using Scaffold. We downloaded the GO annotation file for human gene (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/GO/goa/HUMAN/gene_association.goa_human.gz) on February 6, 2014 and used this GO file for annotation using Scaffold. The spectrum identification results are deposited in Supplementary Table 3, including the ion m/z, peptide sequence, PLGS score, X! Tandem score, charge, intensity, etc. The Supplementary Table 3 is an output from Scaffold using “export” function for spectrum report with minor editing. Statistics on the spectrum and protein identification reported by Scaffold is summarized in Supplementary Table 4. It should be noted that the “Show lower scoring matches” of Scaffold was disabled when reporting and exporting the identification results. The spectra of eight representative proteins identified in the fibroblast secretomes are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, together with an illustration of the sequence coverage of each protein across different proteomic analyses. The spectra and the sequence coverage illustrations were extracted from the Scaffold results. To get a precise prediction, the subcellular localization analysis was performed using multiple methods. The cellular component annotations by Gene Ontology (GO) of the identified proteins were extracted from the flat text file retrieved from UniProt DB (hwww.uniprot.org). Similarly, the GO annotation of the cellular component was analyzed using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). SignalP v4.1 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) and Phobius (http://phobius.sbc.su.se/) were chosen to analyze the classical SP. Proteins longer than 6000 amino acids were excluded from analysis by SignalP. Non-classical SPs were predicted using SecretomeP v2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SecretomeP/), with a length restriction of less than 4000 amino acids. Additionally, the subcellular localization was predicted using WoLF PSORT (http://wolfpsort.seq.cbrc.jp/). Potential exosome protein were revealed by comparing the protein names and accessions with those registered in ExoCarta DB version 4.1 (http://www.exocarta.org) [17] and Vesiclipedia DB version 2.1 (http://www.microvesicles.org/) [18]. All of these information were integrated in Supplementary Table 2 and manually checked and a final annotation was made for each protein. To address the functionalities of the identified proteins, we silenced the coding genes of these proteins in a normal colonic fibroblast cell line, CCD-18Co, and then performed coculture assays with colon cancer cells. Follistatin-related protein 1 (FSTL1) was chosen for ectopic expression analysis in CCD-19Co, which was used for coculture assays. The small interference RNAs (siRNAs) and cloning primers are listed in Supplementary Table 5. GO enrichment analysis was performed using DAVID and significant enrichment categories were accepted with p value and Benjamini value less than 0.05. The enrichment analysis results are shown in Supplementary Table 6. Tissue specificity gene expression enrichment was analyzed using the Gene Enrichment Profiler (http://xavierlab2.mgh.harvard.edu/EnrichmentProfiler/). The results for tissue expression enrichment are embedded in Supplementary Table 2. The identified fibroblast proteins were compared with a batch of known proteomic analyses of colon cancer cells to evaluate their specific expression properties [7–16]. The identified proteins of these reports varied from ~40 to 2300. The comparison was mainly based on official gene symbols. In cases when needed, the International Protein Index (IPI) accessions were mapped to gene symbols and UniProt accessions using the Protein Identifier Cross-Reference (PICR) (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/picr/). The analyzing results were integrated in Supplementary Table 2. Area-proportional Venn diagram was generated with BioVenn (http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/cdd/biovenn/index.php).',\n"," 'Despite the investment of billions of dollars, development of new drugs and other potential disease interventions remain elusive and immensely expensive. The average pre-approval cost of research and development for a successful drug is estimated to be US$2.6 billion [1] and the number of new drugs approved per billion US dollars spent has halved approximately every 9 years since 1950 [2]. More than 90% of drug candidates entering clinical trials fail to gain regulatory approval, mainly as a result of insufficient efficacy and/or unacceptable toxicity, because of the limited predictive value of preclinical studies [3]. One analysis of attrition rates between 1991 and 2000, using data from ten big pharma companies in the EU and USA, found Phase 2 and 3 failures of 62% and 45%, respectively [4]. Although there is widespread acknowledgement that the likelihood of success varies with therapeutic area (oncology has particularly low success rates [5]), it is clear that drug candidates are failing between Phase 2 and submission, where the possible efficacy is put to the test. A more recent study of failures between 2011 and 2012 confirmed that attrition between Phase 2 and submission was because of issues with efficacy (56% of failures) and safety (28% of failures) [6]. Although this might suggest that early termination decisions at Phase 2 support the drug development pipeline, analysis of inflation-adjusted trends in the drug discovery process (Fig. 1) reveals an alarming downward trajectory that has not been significantly impacted by the rise of new technologies and that, without significant intervention, will result in the new drug pipeline drying up completely within 50 years. At the same time, great advances have been made in life science technologies and computer science, increasing our ability to generate and analyze data, yet there is a growing recognition that, to improve the success rate, a stronger focus on human-relevant data is needed [7,8]. How do we exploit these advances and current investments to best address understanding of human disease and improve drug discovery? The BioMed21 Collaboration and global scientific workshop series (http://biomed21.org) was launched by Humane Society International (HSI) to bring together a range of stakeholders with the overall aim of leveraging existing projects to improve health research. The third workshop in the BioMed21 series was held in Bethesda, Maryland in June 2017, and explored existing approaches and potential improvements in the development, access, storage, and evaluation of human-relevant information with the goal of enhancing human disease research and drug discovery. Co-organized by The Humane Society of the United States, HSI, the Human Toxicology Project Consortium (HTPC; http://humantoxicologyproject.org) and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), the workshop was divided into four sessions, each followed by group discussions. The first session set the stage regarding what is needed in the context of current efforts. The second session concentrated on how to turn big data into knowledge, examining how to use the large-scale data-mining initiatives currently underway to improve predictive modeling. The third session reviewed current, advanced cellular and in silico technologies, such as organs-on-chips, systems biology- and pathways-based approaches, and explored how these could be built on to better understand human biology. The final session looked at coordination and support, discussing the potential roles of academia, industry, regulators, and funding agencies. This workshop necessarily was limited in scope; there are many other relevant, related projects that we were unfortunately unable to give due consideration to, including the Human Cell Atlas (www.humancellatlas.org), the Virtual Physiological Human (www.vph-institute.org), and the Human Brain initiative (www.humanbrainproject.eu). Although we were unable to discuss all of these initiatives in the workshop, we recognize the value of their content and their likely impact, as the field of human-relevant research continues to widen. The 21st century has already seen many pivotal advances in science and technology. New approaches to unravel the detailed molecular mechanisms of both normal physiology and disease states are improving at an exponential rate, from complex methods for culturing cells and reconstructed tissues, through measurements of cellular changes at a molecular level (so-called ‘omics technologies) to vastly improved computing capacity that can be applied to make sense of the huge volumes of data. There are several government- and industry-driven initiatives to provide better biological information, to mine, collate, and curate existing information, and to create and link databases to better use this information. Together, these initiatives offer the possibility of gaining a dynamic, systems-level, and human-specific molecular understanding of the causes and pathophysiologies of diseases, including those conditions that represent previously intractable public health challenges to our society [9], and to use this understanding to provide better interventions. This molecular mechanism-level of understanding is vital, in view of ongoing translational difficulties in many areas of health research and drug discovery [2,10,11]. The challenge is how to best identify, prioritize, and implement the strategies that can turn these ideas and new initiatives into practice. One initiative, the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS; https://ncats.nih.gov), was created within the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2012 to facilitate the translation of new findings in basic research into improved diagnostics and therapeutics. The approach of NCATS involves several themes that were reiterated throughout the workshop: collaboration across disciplines and organizations, effective linking of research on disease mechanisms with clinical outcomes, and the importance of joining forces with other agencies to fund larger projects to mutual benefit. Examples of NCATS implementation include the creation of interdisciplinary teams to solve longstanding problems, from attacking rare diseases to developing better models for drug and toxicity testing; in addition, the collaboration between NCATS and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is investing millions of dollars to advance the use of organs-on-chips in drug screening (https://ncats.nih.gov/preclinical/testing). Currently, diseases are categorized by phenotype, for example ‘lung cancer’ or ‘autism’; often, these diseases are in fact a spectrum that might or might not share root causes or molecular mechanisms. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying disease is likely to improve our ability to better identify patient populations and target more effective interventions. To bridge this gap, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) created the Research Domain Criteria framework project (RDoC; www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/rdoc/index.shtml) to realign patients with the molecular signatures of their underlying disease, with the goal of improving the development of novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Accordingly, NIMH has realigned its funding of basic research away from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM) categories and toward a mechanistic understanding of disease. In another example, multi-omics analysis has been used to reveal subsets of type 2 [12] and nontype 2 asthma [13], with specific disease-driving mechanisms that are not discernible from clinical features alone [14]. This work is aimed toward improving precision medicine for respiratory disease by identifying patient groups based on molecular signatures, allowing the development of therapeutics targeted to their specific subtype of asthma. Ever more sophisticated tissue culturing systems involving the development or reconstruction of 3D tissues are being applied for the study of more complete, relevant human biology in vitro. The most sophisticated of these 3D models are the so-called ‘organs-on-chips’, which show great promise for understanding both normal human physiology and disease mechanisms [15]. Microengineered, so-called ‘microphysiological systems’ (MPS), contain cultures of human cells with dynamic fluid flow that recreate nutritional delivery, mechanical forces, and biomolecular gradients, such as those experienced in vivo, and aim to emulate biological processes at a microscopic scale. Recent advances have seen the addition of mechanical coupling to recreate blood flow, the formation of bile canaliculi, and dynamic airflow, for models of the brain, liver, and lungs, respectively [16–18]. NCATS has initiated a large multidisciplinary Tissue Chip Program the goal of which is to develop a ten-organ system via grants to various organizations (https://ncats.nih.gov/tissuechip). The program is currently developing the ten organ microphysiological systems together with the engineering necessary to link them as microfluidic devices. One project has already developed vascularized tumors on-a-chip, and the next phases of the program are to develop a broader spectrum of disease models, and to formulate the processes for validation of these models. This effort involves several other National Institutes and an investment of approximately US$75 million over 5 years. As part of the Tissue Chip Program funded by NIH, along with DARPA and the FDA, the Wyss Institute at Harvard University is developing organ-chips for several different organs, including a breathing lung, intestine, kidney, skin, bone marrow, and blood–brain barrier (https://wyss.harvard.edu/technology/human-organs-on-chips). The lung-chip, for example, combines design, engineering, and biology to allow the chip to recreate the 3D living microenvironment required to achieve organ-level function. The alveolar lung-chip replicates a variety of the normal functions of human alveolar tissue. By incorporating an endothelial cell layer along with immune cells, this chip demonstrates an appropriate response to inflammation, including blood clot formation [19]. Organ-chips can be fabricated from healthy humans, or other species, for chemical testing [20] and, importantly, chips developed using cells from patients have been shown to replicate some specific disease features [21]. Commercialization is a requirement of the DARPA-funded projects, and the organ-chip platform developed by the Wyss Institute at Harvard has been spun-out into a commercial entity, Emulate, Inc. (https://emulatebio.com). Emulate and the FDA recently entered a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to evaluate and qualify the use of the organs-on-chips technology as a platform for toxicology testing to meet regulatory evaluation criteria for products, including foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. The evaluation is dependent on the context of application: the nature of the drug, its intended exposure, and target patient population. This is an integral part of a larger strategy to implement new methods within FDA that involves strong collaboration with technology developers, between centers at FDA, and with other agencies and governments using these new technologies. In some areas (e.g., reproductive and developmental toxicity), FDA is developing specific roadmaps for implementation. The organ-chip approach addresses some of the limitations of 2D models, and even some of the issues with other 3D models [22]. However, many challenges remain. These include the initial start-up costs of setting up microengineered systems, and the variety of possible device designs and culture parameters that can affect reproducibility between labs. Additionally, validation efforts are critical and very much underway. The Tissue Chip Testing Centers initiative (https://ncats.nih.gov/tissuechip/projects/centers) is a joint venture between NCATS, FDA, and the International Consortium for Innovation and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development (the IQ Consortium), tasked with pushing validation efforts forward. The concurrent analysis of multiple chips is in progress, with preparation of several manuscripts for chip validation data ongoing. The Toxicology in the 21st Century initiative (known as Tox21) is a federal collaboration among the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), NIH, including NCATS and the National Toxicology Program (NTP) at the NIEHS, and the FDA (https://ncats.nih.gov/tox21). Using a high-throughput robotic screening system housed at NCATS and diverse assay platforms, researchers are testing thousands of environmental chemicals in hundreds of in vitro and cell-based assays for their potential to disrupt targets or biological pathways that might result in toxicity. To date, the high-throughput screening effort has produced almost a hundred million experimental data points: all of these data have been made freely available to the public. Crowdsourcing of the publicly available data is being used to create predictive models that can predict toxicity outcomes. Screening results give a profile of potential biological activity of each chemical and relative activities can be used to prioritize chemicals for further in-depth investigation. Screening results can also be used to inform biological pathways involved in different types of toxicity. As examples of its utility, data from EPA’s Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast; www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecasting) have been used to effectively screen chemicals for estrogenic activity [23], and have been combined with high-throughput modeling to prioritize chemicals for risk assessment [24]. Fundamental to the new approaches is the concept of using knowledge of biological pathways or networks (systems biology) to improve our understanding of disease. Data-driven discovery of biological pathways infer pathways from molecular associations, whereas curated pathway frameworks are assembled and assessed manually from data sources, including published literature. These varied approaches to systems biology serve different functions, the first to discover previously unknown pathways and associations, the second to form a reliable basis upon which to found hypothesis-driven research or regulatory decisions. Significant investment is being made in systems biology approaches to medicine and disease (e.g., The Virtual Physiological Human, www.vph-institute.org; Big Data to Knowledge, https://commonfund.nih.gov/bd2k; the Cancer Systems Biology consortium, http://csbconsortium.org; and Cancer Target Discovery and Development, https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/ctd2). These approaches are focused on mining existing literature, building associative biological networks from ‘omics data (e.g., genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics), preclinical and clinical data, and using these data to develop computational and mathematical models. These projects are making great strides in developing data-mining and bioinformatics capability to collect and organize data and in creating experimental approaches and technologies that facilitate systems biology research. The challenge for these approaches will be in how to fully incorporate biological contexts, such as cell type, tissue context, and disease state. Improved understanding of the complexities of cancer through increased levels of data integration is the goal of the Cancer Systems Biology Consortium (http://csbconsortium.org), a community of experimental biologists and computer modelers integrating data from a variety of sources, including clinical samples, single cell analyses, network inference, image analysis, machine learning, and evolutionary theory, to build, test, and validate hypotheses and ideas. A systems biology methodology revealed a post-translational mechanism of drug resistance that was not apparent from transcriptomic analysis alone [25]. Systems biology approaches will be vital in understanding the incredible breadth of data that arises as measurements move towards the single cell level. Ultimately, these approaches will be applied to improving personalized cancer therapeutics. Network representations have recently made the leap from social sciences, where they have been applied for decades, to systems biology. Network mappings can provide a picture of the interaction between molecules, represent the relative abundance of those molecules, and provide molecular insights into the organization of signaling pathways, protein–protein interactions, or metabolism, that would not be possible from studying individual proteins or genes. An important finding in many network analyses is that associative networks can elucidate relationships that cannot be seen when comparing single or small sets of genes, proteins, or other components. Although there is inherent uncertainty in translating between preclinical models and humans for drug safety testing, recent advances in ‘omics-based associative network modeling provide a mechanism to reduce this uncertainty. Sutherland and colleagues used open-source databases of changes in rat liver gene expression in response to drugs to derive co-expression networks of gene sets with correlated expression patterns (‘modules’) [26]. Module scores for gene sets, indicative of induction or repression of expression, were mapped to 36 toxicity phenotypes, derived from standard pathological assessment of liver injury (i.e., histology and biochemistry assays) and showed that pathogenic mechanisms of liver injury were associated with changes in gene expression. Importantly, analysis of the relationships between toxicity phenotype and module scores for single drug doses within the first 24 h showed that module–phenotype associations in fact preceded liver injury. This approach, when compared with in vivo data from rat bile duct ligation, was shown to have more discriminatory power, identifying sixfold more genes than the animal models, indicating the potential to map phenotype–gene interactions that precede liver injury and suggesting that, with the incorporation of gene-set analysis, 1-day safety studies could be used to predict adverse outcomes. The application of rat data has the potential to reduce animal use, and could also aid in predicting human outcomes; rat-derived co-expression networks were shown to have predictive capacity for the identification of diagnostic gene markers for human liver disease [26]. This type of approach could also be applied to identify potential modes of action of relevance to drug-induced liver failure, facilitating the prediction of this currently idiopathic effect. Systems biology approaches are also being applied to understanding and predicting prospectively adverse, off-target drug effects, as well as to identifying potentially susceptible populations. To facilitate this approach, the FDA has initiated activities to overcome serious barriers to the integration of the appropriate data, including: improved ontologies for describing clinical and preclinical data; mining relevant data sources and transferring the data to appropriate databases; and defining and describing linkages between molecular signatures and human clinical phenotypes. Although this approach is seen as the essential way forward, these efforts are in the early stages, much work remains that entails enormous collaboration and the generation of successful case studies [27]. The curated pathway framework concept is being developed and implemented in toxicology as ‘Adverse Outcome Pathways’ (AOPs). The AOP framework provides a system for gathering, organizing, and evaluating biological data related to the sequence of causal relationships between a molecular initiating event (e.g., a chemical binding to a cellular receptor) and adverse outcomes connected by key events at the molecular, cellular, organ, organism, and population levels. The AOP-based concept (Fig. 2) evolved from the concept of mode of action as it relates to chemical toxicity [28]. A collaboration between the European Commission, the US EPA and the Organization for Economic Coordination and Development (OECD) is developing the necessary software, and databases and guidance, to build and evaluate AOPs and AOP networks; the AOP knowledge base (http://aopkb.org). One element of the framework is the AOP wiki (https://aopwiki.org), a crowd-sourced, wiki-based platform to collect, organize, and facilitate the evaluation of biological information according to extensive guidance provided by the OECD [29]. The AOP framework takes a step-wise and well-curated approach to building biological networks. The pathway elements (‘key events’) and their relationships are described using the best-available information in such a way that each element can be taken as a building block for related pathways, and networks develop organically as more information is added to the knowledgebase. This process requires that the framework be fairly prescriptive yet flexible to accommodate crowd-sourcing and changing information. AOPs are not intended to capture all detail, but rather the essential elements and relationships: key events should be essential (but not necessarily sufficient) for the pathway to progress and measurable, and key event relationships describe the activity dependence (e.g., response–response relationships) between the adjacent key events. Each AOP and AOP network is necessarily a living document. Nevertheless, the AOPs are periodically reviewed for accuracy and completeness via a formal OECD process. A benefit of this framework is that it is a way for all available biological knowledge to be used to support weight-of-evidence decisions, to design hypothesis-based testing strategies, and to improve predictive modeling. The downsides of this approach are its labor-intensive nature, the current limitation to toxicology and regulatory applications, and need for well-defined ontologies to facilitate data mining. A recent effort from the EPA and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission has extended AOP ontologies, mapping key events within existing AOP onto conventional ontology terms to aid further development of AOP, incorporating more genomic data, and to support computer modeling [30]. The short-term application of AOP is to provide increased certainty for regulatory decision-making regarding chemical toxicity; however, the AOP framework could also be applied to better understanding of disease and drug discovery. Although outside the scope of the AOP framework, an important element of the application of AOPs is the context of use, which includes the specific decision framework, including any exposure considerations. The OECD has developed the concept of Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment, which includes guidance for the context-dependent use of AOPs [31]. Improved technologies are a necessary part of the solution; however, as the above example highlights, improved use of data is also crucial. The pharmaceutical industry has generated an enormous amount of relevant data, yet much of them are not leveraged to enable better medical application. Massive amounts of data from preclinical, clinical, and postmarket surveillance exist, but are stored in disparate places (often not public, searchable, or in a format useful for building upon) and not using the same vocabulary. Standardization of data reporting, in line with current FDA requirements for clinical trial data, could enable analysis of the dormant but valuable data currently in existence but often in these different, incompatible formats. For example, the EU Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) eTOX project (www.etoxproject.eu), was designed to mine pharmaceutical databases, align the data by translating different vocabularies into a consistent ontology, then use the data to identify new linkages between information (e.g., new structure–activity relationships), thus allowing the development of better predictive tools. This project is based on the data from a large consortium of pharmaceutical companies, a fruitful application of the concept that companies must collaborate to compete more effectively. In the USA, the NIH has several large-scale projects underway to extract data from existing sources and make those data available for biological analyses. For example, the NIH Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) project (www.lincsproject.org) is a cloud-based collection encompassing cell type data, perturbation data, and assay data (including ‘omics, microenvironment, and imaging studies). The LINCS data sets provide multiple assay results for cell lines and human primary cells following treatment with ‘perturbagens’, such as growth factors, cytokines, and genetic alterations. Interrogation of the impact of a perturbagen on multiple cell types, at multiple time points, and for multiple doses, is possible, and aligns with the overall intention: to build a new, network-based understanding of human health and disease via a catalog of so-called ‘cellular signatures’. A recent LINCS analysis revealed the utility of moving away from the traditional IC50 analysis used to estimate antineoplastic drug efficacy in vitro, instead using the data set from the Genentech Cell Line Screening Initiative (gCSI) [32] to evaluate growth rate metrics. Analysis based on growth rate can take account of differences in proliferation rates that occur for different cell types, with different assay conditions (culture medium, duration, and plating density) and in the presence of different (natural or induced) genetic mutations. Overall, the quantification of growth rate metrics improves cross study reproducibility and preclinical pharmacogenomics, providing a more accurate estimate of in vitro effects that is invaluable in informing likely in vivo sensitivities [33]. The LINCS project is also creating analytical tools for researchers to query the data for their own applications. In what could be a model for wider adoption, the LINCS project has adopted the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable principles (www.force11.org/fairprinciples) to ensure that the data are universally usable by other researchers; this approach is being widely promoted by other programs in the USA and further afield [34,35]. The pilot project Biomedical Data Translator (ncats.nih.gov/translator) aims to generate a community effort to develop a highly collaborative approach to integrate multiple types of existing clinical and biomedical research data source, including disease symptoms, drug effects, and biological data relevant to understanding pathophysiology. The ultimate goal of the Translator project is to create an automated system capable of feeding disparate knowledge sources into a centralized workspace via a controller, providing novel ways to analyze existing data and enable problem solving. Eventually, the comprehensive integration of diverse data sets, ranging from disease names and clinical symptoms through cell types and pathways to genes, mutations, and drugs, would allow the identification of novel relationships among diseases and identification of new intervention opportunities. A pilot project (TransMed) was designed to uncover the biological mechanisms of Fanconi anemia, an hereditary blood disease. This project is connecting genetic pathways with clinical phenotypes, using tools as they are developed in the Translator project (https://htpconsortium.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2-3-chute_biomed21-transmed-26june2017.pdf). Case studies are vital tools for demonstrating the potential and extent to which the new tools could be used for disease understanding, for indicating the predictive capacity of the new techniques, and for increasing confidence in the data generated from the new methods. For this reason, we discussed case studies throughout the workshop, two of which are described below. Scientists at ScitoVation are using a combination of bioinformatics and computational tools, bespoke in vitro assays, and pharmacokinetic-based modeling to identify more effective cancer therapeutics. To try and understand the likely mechanism of action, this case study mapped the genetic diversity of a panel of cell lines onto their sensitivity to genotoxins, linking the compound effect to the genetic background. The researchers then developed models that incorporated machine learning to predict drug efficacy, using mutation status and gene expression. ScitoVation’s global approach to drug discovery uses computational toxicology to identify promising molecules based on previous molecules with a known mode of action. A combination of in vitro methods and ‘omics characterizations are used to characterize efficacy (e.g., effects on cell division) and possible mechanisms of off-target effects to provide a biological based understanding of a chemical dose response. Therapeutics can be identified that specifically target certain tumor types and lack identifiable off-target activity [36]. In a complementary approach, phenotypic profiling of chemicals or drugs in cell-based assays can be used to identify cellular response ‘fingerprints’ that identify mechanisms of action [37]. The BioMAP approach taken by DiscoverX uses primary human cell-based assay models of tissue and disease and a reference database of known drug signatures to screen drugs for potential mechanisms of action for both efficacy and safety. This can be applied to prioritize lead or hit compounds identified from phenotypic drug screens, selecting for the required dose and activity, and discarding compounds with toxicity-associated signatures. Importantly, these phenotypic models were shown to be effective for investigating secondary activities, and signatures from the reference database were used to develop predictive classifiers for selected toxicity mechanisms. Traditionally, molecular target identification uses techniques, such as biochemical target-based assays or affinity-binding chromatography, that are decoupled from the biological pathways and that fail to detect off-target binding activities. By contrast, these human-based phenotypic models, by enabling detection of full pathways, provide compound categorization for numerous specific mechanism classes, permit identification of diverse off-target toxicity mechanisms, and can assist in the deconvolution of targets for compounds derived from phenotypic drug discovery. For the past several years, our ability to generate data has far exceeded our capacity to interpret and make use of the resulting information. Technology is advancing at an ever-accelerating pace and there is a great need to leverage these advances more efficiently and effectively. Both industry and governments (in the USA and EU in particular) have initiated large-scale programs to begin to address these demands. This workshop was held to highlight some of these efforts and discuss future needs and potential ways forward. Directed discussions followed each session and the workshop concluded with a panel discussion incorporating representatives of the major stakeholder groups (funding agencies, regulators, academia, industry, and civil society), who addressed the critical factors both preventing and necessary for optimal collaboration and success. To most effectively address complex issues, interdisciplinary and often international collaborations are necessary. Several flagship projects involving large interdisciplinary, interagency, and even international collaborations, including several NIH initiatives (NCATS-led Translator and LINCS), the NIH/DARPA/FDA organ-on-a-chip program, and the Microphysiological Systems Consortium, have established programs that successfully combine the necessary expertise in biology, materials science, and engineering. The Tox21 collaboration between the FDA, NIH, and EPA has brought together government and industry scientists and regulators to successfully develop high-throughput in vitro models for predicting chemical and drug toxicity. The US Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) establishes partnerships between method developers, regulators, and industry to increase confidence and ensure regulatory uptake of novel approaches. The IMI eTOX project involves a large collaboration of pharmaceutical companies to provide data to identify new linkages between information and build better predictive tools. The National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Cancer Systems Biology Consortium brings together a range of experimental biologists and computational and mathematical analysts to integrate molecular, cellular and tissue-level data with the goal of creating a systems-level comprehension of cancer states. The OECD AOP Development Program is applying crowdsourcing as a way to increase pathway-based information; the more participation, the greater the coverage of biological space, and the more useful the knowledgebase becomes. There was acknowledgement that, although these efforts involve different stakeholders and address different needs, it is important to establish and maintain communication and awareness to avoid overlap and introduce interoperability as much as possible. The discussants were in general agreement that going forward, it would be beneficial to include patient groups, which could be powerful allies and could be better informed to garner their support. It is also important to broaden stakeholder participation to make toxicology an early part of research and development, not an add-on or late-stage investigation. This should also include funding agency involvement to incentivize team work and open science, following, for example, the European IMI pattern for public–private partnerships. Better access to, and higher quality of, data are essential. A large amount of in vivo and in vitro data exists, but the data are siloed in different databases, some of which are proprietary, and in different formats, and some of which are not machine readable. Incentives are needed to increase availability of human and drug-related data currently considered confidential or proprietary. Incentives might include requirements to submit all study data to publicly accessible databases as part of funding or publication agreements. It was felt that the precedent of funding bodies and journals requiring that all transcriptomics data be submitted to public databases as a condition of funding and/or publication should be extended to preclinical data more broadly. There is a requirement for standardization of data repositories and translational research and knowledge management platforms, such as tranSMART, that will enable integration and crosstalk between data sets and/or platforms [38,39]. A key challenge remains access to data submitted to regulatory agencies as part of new drug applications, for existing mechanisms under the Freedom of Information Act are ill-suited to large-scale data curation activities. To facilitate data integration, the development or adoption of a comprehensive ontology or an overarching set of interoperable ontologies is necessary. In addition, it will be crucial to develop reporting standards, such as those developed for eTOX and the Monarch Initiatives, for all types of data, from in vitro, ‘omics to standard animal and clinical data. Several strategies to facilitate participation, including gamification, the development of interactive software, or crowd-sourced challenges, were proposed. There was a recommendation to explore an international collaboration for a publicly supported public database (like the AOP-Wiki), that supports not only data collection, but also data integration and biological pathway and network development. Some thought that a single, overarching database was not necessary and that it was preferable to have a set of databases specialized for different types of data and make these databases inter-relatable. In addition to issues of availability, it is becoming evident that much, if not most, of the publicly available historical data are of questionable quality. Therefore, it was generally felt that large-scale gathering of historical data might only be fruitful with a significant curation effort, and that resources might be better directed toward generating higher quality data going forward, using better designed protocols, standardized templates, and common or interoperable ontologies. The adoption of electronic formats such as SEND (CDISC Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data) will substantially reduce technical hurdles. In addition, microphysiological systems provide a new opportunity to push the field towards this standard because these systems have the potential to generate a significant amount of high-quality, human-relevant data. However, a complication is that the definition of data quality can depend on context and what is defined as an acceptable level of uncertainty. For example, data from animal models assume a level of confidence because of internal controls, whereas patient data have more uncertainty. In addition to increased attention to standard operating procedures and quality control measures, another way to increase data quality is to make all of the experimental data public and subject to review. A true shift in paradigm will require a greater emphasis on human relevance, from top-down funding decisions to data generation to building of databases and/or knowledge management tools. In the meantime, some participants felt that it might be possible to carry out further exploration and publication of case studies using animal cells on chips. However, because this option requires animals to be sacrificed to isolate the relevant primary cell types, this approach does not meet the objective of reducing the use of animals for ethical purposes. Comparisons of these data to in vivo data are needed to show the predictivity of organs-on-chips and improve confidence in new technologies There are several ongoing efforts to collect human relevant data from in vitro tests or clinical studies, analyze these data, and apply them to better understand human physiology. These efforts are key if the drug development productivity is to stop stagnating and become vibrant and active once more. However, for this to be a success, data collection and reporting must be standardized, data quality must be ensured, and data sharing should be incentivized. Successful integration of all types of data requires consistent or interoperable ontologies. Changes at the molecular level need to be linked to clinical phenotypes and genotypes. Emphasis on human-based methods, such as organoids and tissue-on-a-chip approaches using primary disease cells, must be a priority for future funding calls globally. The recommendations identified through the BioMed21 Collaboration workshop series (Box 1 and [40]), in discussion with federal agencies, funding agencies, regulators, and academics, have the potential to revitalize drug discovery, enabling target discovery and accelerating more effective and efficient translation of novel therapies.',\n"," 'HIV/AIDS is a serious global epidemic the world is facing today. While anti-retroviral drugs have been highly effective in controlling viremia, there is no cure. And, despite over 30 years of concerted efforts worldwide, there still is no HIV vaccine. A preventative vaccine that can block HIV transmission is considered to be the best option to control and ultimately eradicate this disease. HIV presents numerous challenges for the design of an effective prophylactic vaccine. These include extensive viral diversity; very early establishment of latent viral reservoirs; evolution of mutations in the trimeric envelope protein (Env) in response to the host immune response; complex glycosylation that forms a shield over the Env ectodomain hindering the antibodies from reaching the critical epitopes; and lack of a suitable animal model for determining the correlates of protection and vaccine efficacy. Despite these challenges, several human phase III clinical trials using a variety of HIV-1 immunogen formulations have been conducted. All have thus far failed except for the RV144 Thai trial which showed a modest efficacy of ~31% at 42 months and 60% at 12 months after initiation of vaccination (Rerks-Ngarm et al., 2009; Robb et al., 2012). Binding antibodies specific to the V2 domain of the envelope HIV-1 glycoprotein, but not neutralizing antibodies, correlated with protection in the RV144 phase III trial (Haynes et al., 2012). Further, vaccine induced polyfunctional CD4+ T-cell subsets were shown to be associated with decreased risk of HIV infection in the same trial (Lin et al., 2015). One of the major strategies to prevent acquisition of HIV has been to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). These antibodies arise in individuals during the chronic phase of HIV-1; however, these antibodies are not able to control the disease at that late stage. Whether they can prevent infection if administered passively is being tested in high risk volunteers in an ongoing HVTN 703 (AMP) trial. These bNAbs can also be generated in vitro from B cells of individuals with chronic infection and have been shown to neutralize several different strains and subtypes of HIV-1 (Chuang et al., 2013; Falkowska et al., 2014; Georgiev et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2014, 2012; Liao et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2011, 2009; Wu et al., 2010). However, in the current neutralization assays, the read-out of virus infectivity is days (in vitro) or weeks (in vivo) after infection. Hence, these time-points are far removed from the initial virus entry. Moreover, replication-incompetent, in vitro-cell line produced, pseudoviruses, which are used for assessing neutralization may not be the same as the viral inoculum humans are exposed to during HIV-1 transmission. Therefore, a critical gap exists in the current paradigm due to the lack of quantitative data on virus capture and entry at timescales relative to natural primary virus infection. Such data are essential to directly measure the efficiency of virus capture and entry; determine the effectiveness of bNAbs or immune sera to block virus capture; and to design efficacious preventative vaccines that can block HIV-1 infection. In this study, we developed a quantitative high-throughput assay to examine early events after exposure of primary HIV-1 to host cells. We found that the primary virus was captured by the host cells and converted into a trypsin-resistant form in less than five minutes. Unexpectedly, we observed that this capture was not inhibited by potent bNAbs, although the bNAbs inhibited subsequent steps of entry and viral replication. Furthermore, we found that the bNAbs must be present in the initial minutes of exposure of the virus to the host cells. Otherwise, a significant portion of the primary viruses escaped even if bNAbs were present for the rest of the infection period. On the other hand, capture of pseudoviruses and infectious molecular clones (IMCs) was inhibited by the bNAbs implicating fundamental differences between the envelopes of primary viruses and pseudoviruses and their recognition by host cells. These findings raise the possibility that at least some of the primary viruses that the humans are exposed to might escape bNAbs and establish early reservoirs. Therefore, it might be necessary to induce capture-blocking antibodies in addition to bNAbs to completely prevent HIV-1 infection during sexual transmission. Our studies thus provide new insights on the mechanisms of HIV-1 transmission and have implications for the design of more effective HIV-1 vaccines.

Cells were grown to confluency and used for experiments starting at day three. The following reagent was obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: 8E5/LAV from Dr. Thomas Folks. The 8E5 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 containing 05% FBS, 1% L-Glutamine, and 1% Pen/Strep at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were harvested and then processed for DNA isolation using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen) for cellular and viral DNA standards for qRT-PCR. A3R5.7 cells grown in G418 media were harvested and then plated. Purified primary virus (preparation and purification as described in Supplemental Information) was added to the wells and the plates were incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 5 or 30 min. Cells and virus were then centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the virus was removed and the cells were washed and treated with trypsin. Cell pellets were frozen at −20 °C, and then later processed for RNA extraction. For details see Supplemental Information. A3R5.7 cells were plated as above. The virus was pre-incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in the absence or presence of mAbs and then added to the cells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 or 30 min and processed as described above. For details see Supplemental Information. A3R5.7 cells were plated as stated above. Purified primary BaL was mixed with media or with 10 million gag RNA copies (gag RNA transcripts were provided by Dr. Mary Kearney, NCI, NIH), added to cells, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The cells were washed, trypsin treated, and processed for RNA isolation as described in Supplemental Information. The cells were seeded and infected with virus as described above for the capture assay. Followed by washing and trypsin treatment, cells were resuspended in media, and incubated for 1 h or 48 h at 37 °C, after which the cells were harvested, and washed as described in the Supplemental Information. The supernatants were analyzed using p24 ELISA kit (ABL, Inc). The final cell pellets were split into 2 aliquots and each pellet was processed for RNA and DNA extraction. Assay details are in Supplemental Information. Cells were prepared as described above for the HIV-1 capture assay with bNAbs. Cells were washed, trypsin treated, resuspended in media containing either mAbs or T20, incubated at 37 °C for 48 h, and then harvested. The viral supernatant was collected and the cells pellets were washed with ice cold PBS. A portion of the viral supernatant and cell pellets was processed for nucleic acid extraction. Experiments to further understand the mechanism of inhibition of viral replication by VRC01 was performed in a similar way as noted above. However, the cells were infected with the virus (pre-incubated in the absence or presence of mAb) for 30 min, washed, trypsin treated, and after further washes, resuspended in media. There were three conditions: (i) the virus and cells were incubated together for 30 min in the absence of VRC01. Following trypsin treatment and washes as noted above, VRC01 was added and present during the 48 h incubation; (ii) the antibody and virus were pre-incubated for 15 min and then added to the cells for 30 min. Following trypsin treatment and washes, the antibody was added and was also present during the 48-h incubation; (iii) the antibody and virus was pre-incubated for 15 min and then the mixture was added to the cells for 30 min. Following trypsin treatment and washes, cells were incubated for 48 h in media in the absence of VRC01, see Fig. 5A. A3R5.7 cells were washed with ice cold PBS before being resuspended in 10% goat sera. Anti-CD4 antibody was added to the cells in goat sera at a final concentration of 20 μg/mL and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. The cells were then washed, resuspended in media, and infected with purified primary BaL, BaL.ec1 pseudovirus, BaL IMC, CM235 pseudovirus, 40061. LucR and C6980V0C72 IMCs as described above in the capture assay experiments. For infections that occurred for 48 h, the samples were processed as described above for the 48-h infection assay. For details see Supplemental Information. A3R5.7 cells were placed in a 37 °C heat block in Eppendorf tubes. The virus was added to the cells (time 0) followed by the addition of VRC01 at 1, 2, or 5 min. The cells and virus were incubated for a total time of 5 min before they were processed as described above, washed with ice cold PBS, and then trypsin treated. After the trypsin treatment, the cells were resuspended in media and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. The cells were then harvested, washed and RNA extracted from the cell pellets. For details, see Fig. 5C and Supplemental Information. RNA was extracted from the infected cell pellets using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Viral RNA present in the supernatant was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). The two-step real-time RT-PCR assay was performed with a Viia7 (Applied Biosystems) using the Taqman RNA-to-Ct kit (Applied Biosystems). DNA detection qPCR assay was performed using the Taqman Universal Master Mix II (Applied Biosystems), Taqman primers, and probes as detailed in the Supplemental Information. Assay acceptability was contingent on the R2 value for the HIV-1 and cell linear regressions were >0.95. We utilized purified primary HIV-1 propagated in PBMCs (Jobe et al., 2012) and the human T lymphoblastoid cell line, A3R5.7, to quantify virus capture. This T cell line expresses CD4, CXCR4, CCR5, and the integrin homing receptor α4β7, in copy numbers similar to that observed on human PBMCs (McLinden et al., 2013). Viral infection with this cell line has been shown to be efficient, productive, and envelope dependent (Marechal et al., 1998). The amount of virus was quantified by measuring viral gag RNA or long-terminal-repeat (LTR) RNA copies present inside the cells by quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) (Fig. 1). We determined the number of viral RNA copies or the number of virus particles associated with 1 million cells after infection for 5 min based on the TCID50 and p24 concentration (Fig. 2A, B). Due to the high sensitivity of qRT-PCR, we performed infection in the absence of reagents used to enhance viral infection, such as DEAE Dextran and polybrene. Moreover, this would be closer to natural infection. Based on these data, we decided to use an amount of virus (~1 ng of p24 = 1x107 viral particles) that infected less than 1% of the cell population such that the amount of viral RNA quantified from these cells was within the linear range. Furthermore, these conditions more closely represented the low multiplicity of infection (MOI) and efficiency of infection observed based on the estimated per-act HIV transmission risk (Patel et al., 2014). In order to eliminate a majority of the virus particles that might be loosely bound to the cell surface, the cells were treated with trypsin, as has been described in previous studies (Marechal et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2007). A3R5.7 cells are sensitive to trypsin treatment and were treated under gentle conditions (0.05% trypsin, 5 min, 25 °C). The remaining viral genomes associated with the cells thus represent captured, and presumably internalized, viruses that are trypsin-resistant (Fig. 1). A series of control experiments were performed to determine that the HIV-1 gag RNA detected was due to virus capture and entry into A3R5.7 cells and not due to nonspecific transfer of free RNA present in the purified HIV-1 preparations. Incubation of A3R5.7 cells with purified BaL along with the exogenous addition of 10 million gag copies did not significantly increase the number of RNA copies observed inside the cells (Fig. S1A). To rule out any nonspecific uptake of the virus, we utilized a purified IMC lacking the env protein (delta env) as another control. Despite the presence of 48 million viral RNA copies in the delta env IMC (see inset in Fig. S1B), there was no viral RNA associated with the cells after 30 min of infection (Fig. S1B). These results demonstrated that the HIV-1 gag RNA copies quantified by qRT-PCR was due to specific envelope-dependent viral capture but not due to nonspecific uptake of free RNA or virus. When A3R5.7 cells were infected with purified subtype B primary BaL for 5 min, ~30,000 copies of gag RNA copies/106 cells were detected, representing the number of cell-associated viral genomes that are trypsin resistant. Increasing the time of infection to 30 min only slightly increased the number of gag RNA copies (Fig. 2C). Thus, 5 min was sufficient for HIV-1 capture by these T cells. The lack of increase in the amount of gag RNA copies observed after a longer time of infection indicates that there is a saturating amount of virus that can be captured by the cells, as well as that the virus that is captured is specific. If non-specific virus uptake was to occur, an increase in gag RNA copies after a longer time of infection would have been observed. Importantly, the virus that was captured was replication competent as shown by i) a 1.8-fold increase in viral RNA copy number after 48 h compared to the 5-min infection (Fig. 2D), ii) the appearance of strong stop viral DNA reverse transcripts (Fig. 2E) and iii) the release of progeny virus into the culture supernatant as determined by p24 ELISA (Fig. 2F), after the subsequent 48-h incubation. Having established a quantitative assay to measure the capture of primary HIV-1 at early time points, we utilized this method to examine the ability of various bNAbs to inhibit HIV-1 infection of A3R5.7 cells with R5 and X4 tropic viruses BaL, CAM0002BBY, and 92UG029 (subtypes B, CRF01_AG, and A respectively). The virus was pre-incubated with the bNAb for 15 min at 37 °C prior to infection of A3R5.7 cells (Fig. 3A). The amount of bNAbs used was 2.5, 5, or 10 µg/mL, which equates to 1.5x1012, 3x1012, or 6x1012 molecules of antibody. Since the amount of virus used was 0.5–1x107 viral particles and each particle contains ~7–14 envelope protein trimers (Chertova et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2006), the amount of mAb used was in great excess compared to the number of trimers present on the virus. The same procedure as above was used except that fresh medium containing the bNAb was added to the infected cells after trypsin-treatment during the 48-h incubation (see Fig. 3A for details). The percentage inhibition by the bNAb was determined by comparing the viral RNA copies associated with the cells in the presence of bNAbs to that in their absence. Synagis, a mAb against Respiratory Syncytia Virus (RSV), and T20, an HIV-1 fusion inhibitor were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. After 48 h of infection, no significant inhibition was observed with Synagis, whereas >90% inhibition was observed with T20 against all 3 subtypes tested (Fig. 3B). The bNAbs directed against different regions of the env protein structure; the V1V2 domain (PG9), V3 loop (PGT121), CD4 binding site (VRC01, b12), glycans (2G12), or MPER (4E10), inhibited the different subtypes to varying degrees (Fig. 3B). PG9 potently inhibited all 3 viruses (70% to 90%), whereas PGT121, VRC01, and b12 inhibited BaL (99%, 85%, and 52%, respectively), and to a lesser extent CAM0002BBY (53% to 16%) and 92UG029 (18% to 9%). The glycan antibody 2G12 and the MPER region antibody 4E10 showed minimal inhibition against all the viruses tested (Fig. 3B). The inhibition observed with PGT121, PG9 and T20 based on the viral RNA copies present inside the cells was mirrored in the gag RNA copies present in the supernatant, indicating that viral production was greatly diminished as represented by the % inhibition (Fig. S2A). Overall, these data obtained at the 48-h time point are in agreement with the previously published work with bNAbs using either luminescence or measurement of p24 as the readout (Chuang et al., 2013; Falkowska et al., 2014; Georgiev et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2014, 2012; Liao et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2011, 2009; Wu et al., 2010). We next analyzed the ability of bNAbs to prevent virus capture at the 5-min time point under the same conditions. Surprisingly, and in contrast to the 48-h time point, neither the bNAbs nor the T20 inhibited viral capture by the A3R5.7 cells. The lack of inhibition of capture was observed with all the viruses examined and was independent of the subtype (Fig. 3C) or the infection time (Fig. 3D). Particularly informative is the lack of inhibition by VRC01, which, due to its high affinity interaction with the CD4 binding site should have blocked virus capture by the CD4 receptor, the first step of the virus entry pathway. The lack of capture inhibition at the 5 min time point was not due to limiting amounts of the antibody since concentrations of even 10 µg/mL of VRC01 showed no significant inhibition when compared to the control Ab (Fig. S2B). At the same concentration, VRC01 inhibited BaL by 98% at the 48-h time point (Fig. S2C). We examined several other antibodies, including the newer class of more potent antibodies such as 3BNC117 (Shingai et al., 2013) and CAP256-VRC26 (Doria-Rose et al., 2014), at 10 µg/mL concentration. 3BNC117 was highly effective at inhibiting viral replication of subtype B primary virus BaL at 48 h (>90% inhibition) but it was unable to inhibit viral capture at the early time points. Similar results were observed with the CAP256-VRC26 mAb with subtype C primary virus, TZBD9/11 (Supplementary Table S1). It has been previously demonstrated that neutralization potency is enhanced when a combination of bNAbs is used (Kong et al., 2015). Therefore, we utilized a cocktail of five potent bNAbs (b12, 4E10, 2G12, PG9 and PGT121, 2.5 µg/mL each) to determine if this could block viral capture during early time points. The bNAb cocktail showed no significant inhibition (<10%) of capture of the primary virus BaL by A3R5.7 cells at both 5 and 30 min of infection (Fig. 3E). In contrast, >95% inhibition was observed at 48 h of infection (Fig. 3E). To determine if purification of the primary virus somehow selected a particular class of HIV-1 particles or virions with altered envelope structures, we performed the 5-min capture/infection experiments with both unpurified and purified viruses from the same batch of primary virus grown in PBMCs. No significant differences were observed; neither the unpurified nor the purified BaL viruses were inhibited by PG9 at the 5-min time point (Fig. 4A). We then examined the ability of PG9 to inhibit the capture of the pseudovirus, BaL.ec1 and BaL IMC. Pseudoviruses and IMCs produced from the 293 T cell line have been the viruses of choice in the current TZM-bl neutralization assays. Strikingly, in contrast to the primary BaL, the capture of pseudovirus BaL.ec1 and the BaL IMC was greatly inhibited, up to 74% and 88%, respectively (Fig. 4A). Similar results were also observed with subtype AE pseudovirus (CM235), the transmitted/founder subtype AE IMC (40061. LucR), and subtype C IMC (C6980V0C72) (Fig. 4A). These results demonstrate that the pseudoviruses and IMCs produced in 293 T cells exhibit a distinct capture phenotype from the primary viruses produced in PBMCs. To further investigate this distinction, we utilized the anti-CD4 mAb SK3 to block HIV-1 capture through CD4, its primary receptor. It was expected that blocking this interaction would block capture of primary viruses as well as pseudoviruses and IMCs. However, the data mirrored that obtained with the bNAbs. Blocking of the CD4 receptor with excess SK3 did not inhibit the capture of the primary BaL (Fig. 4B). In contrast, SK3 greatly inhibited the capture of both the pseudovirus and the IMCs (70–100%) (Fig. 4B). It is important to note that although the anti-CD4 receptor antibody did not block the capture of primary BaL, later processes of viral infection and replication were greatly inhibited (75–88%), at the 48 h time point and similar results were obtained with both unpurified and purified BaL (Fig. S3A). This indicates that although the primary virus may not utilize CD4 for its initial interactions with the T cell, it does require CD4 for later processes including fusion and entry. We also examined the effect of soluble CD4 on the capture of primary and IMC BaL by A3R5.7 cells. Even at a concentration of 5 µg/mL, the protein was unable to inhibit the capture of primary BaL, but was able to inhibit the capture of the BaL IMC (Fig. S3B). These results demonstrate that the capture of pseudoviruses and IMCs by A3R5.7 cells required CD4-interaction, while the capture of primary viruses was independent of CD4 interaction. To evaluate whether the bNAbs need to be present throughout the 48-h incubation period to inhibit virus replication, or if there is a critical time period for the bNAbs to be effective, we performed a series of experiments utilizing three bNAbs, VRC01, PG9, and PGT121 by adding them individually at different time points during the capture and/or infection process. Primary BaL was pre-incubated with media or with the mAb for 15 min followed by the addition to A3R5.7 cells for 30 min for the capture/infection process. Cells from each of the two conditions were then washed, trypsin treated, and either analyzed for gag RNA (30 min time point), or were resuspended in media alone or in media containing the mAb for 48 h and then analyzed for gag RNA (Fig. 5A). The data with VRC01 is shown in Fig. 5B. The controls behaved as described in the earlier experiments (Fig. 3) in that pre-incubation of the virus with VRC01 followed by infection did not result in inhibition of virus capture at the 30-min time point (black bar; Fig. 5B). If however, in addition, VRC01 was also present throughout the 48-h incubation period (positive control; blue bar, Fig. 5B) over 90% inhibition was observed. Interestingly, when VRC01 was pre-incubated with the virus, but was absent during the 48-h incubation (gray bar, Fig. 5B), over 90% inhibition was observed, which was similar to the positive control. On the other hand, if VRC01 was not pre-incubated with the virus, but was only added during the subsequent 48-h incubation (red bar, Fig. 5B), a modest inhibition of only 30% was observed. In this latter scenario, since the mAb was added after the capture, it was not effective in completely blocking the subsequent entry process and generation of productive virus. It is also possible that the mAb inhibited cell-to-cell virus transmission, hence partially effective, in agreement with previous work (Abela et al., 2012; Malbec et al., 2013). These results demonstrate that although the bNAbs do not inhibit primary virus capture, their presence before capture was essential, and sufficient to inhibit viral replication. Similar patterns of inhibition were observed for both PG9 and PGT121 (Fig. S4). To further define the window of time for capture and inhibition by bNAbs, HIV-1 BaL was added to A3R5.7 cells at time 0, followed by the addition of VRC01 after 1, 2, or 5 min (Fig. 5C). Cells were harvested at 5 min, washed, trypsin treated, resuspended in media, and then incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in the absence of VRC01. The data showed that capture occurred within one to two minutes post exposure of the virus with the cells. Addition of VRC01 one or two minutes after virus exposure allowed the escape of ~50% of the viral genomes (Fig. 5D) from inhibition by the bNAb. The escape was up to ~80% when the bNAb was added 5 min after exposure of the virus to cells. These data demonstrate that primary virus is captured by the cells at a fast timescale, in as little as 1 min, after which the virus is no longer fully susceptible to the inhibitory effects of the bNAb. This means that the bNAb must be present before the virus comes into contact with the cells during the capture phase, in order to exert its effect in the subsequent steps of virus entry. It is also important to note that when the bNAb is pre-incubated with the virus before exposure to cells at a saturating concentration, ~7% of the captured viral genomes apparently escaped the inhibitory effect of VRC01 (Fig. 5B, blue bars). Induction of bNAbs by vaccination has been a major driving force in the HIV vaccine field and this is yet to be achieved. However, the basic mechanisms by which bNAbs block infection by diverse viruses are still poorly understood. Furthermore, the dynamics of initial interactions when a primary virus encounters a host cell and the effect of different bNAbs on these interactions have not been thoroughly investigated. These interactions might be important for locating and engaging with the primary CD4 receptor that then leads to membrane fusion and entry, and also for cell-to-cell transmission, an important facet of the viral transmission process. Antibodies which can interfere with these initial interactions might therefore be effective in preventing HIV-1 transmission and establishment of early reservoirs. To address these questions, we developed a quantitative assay and examined the very early time points after exposure of primary HIV-1 to host cells. Our results generated new and some unexpected insights. First, our results demonstrated that primary HIV-1 was captured by the host cells within minutes after exposure. We define “capture” as the attachment of the virus to the host cell and subsequent conversion of the virus into a trypsin-resistant form, probably by internalization (Fig. 6). The efficiency of capture was on the order of 1:100–1:300 viruses, based on the capture of about 30,000 viral genomes (15,000 viruses) per one million A3R5.7 cells in a typical experiment. The captured virus was replication competent as shown by the appearance of strong-stop DNA reverse transcripts in about an hour after capture, an increase in viral genome copy number and the release of progeny viruses into the culture medium during the subsequent 48 h of incubation. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that capture was envelope dependent since neither free RNA nor the virus particles lacking the envelope showed significant capture. The bNAbs inhibited virus production at 48 h in all of our assays. These data are in agreement with numerous previous studies using the TZM-bl and similar neutralization assays (Chuang et al., 2013; Falkowska et al., 2014; Georgiev et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2014, 2012; Liao et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2011, 2009; Wu et al., 2010). Unexpectedly, however, the potent bNAbs did not block the capture of primary virus at the 5-min (or 30-min) time point. The fusion inhibitor T20 also behaved in a similar fashion. This inability to inhibit primary virus capture was consistently observed with all the bNAbs tested, including the highly potent 3BNC117 and CAP256 antibodies, as well as a cocktail of five potent bNAbs. These antibodies recognize various linear and/or conformational epitopes located at different sites on the envelope protein structure. The question therefore is, if the bNAbs do not inhibit primary virus capture, how do they inhibit viral replication at the 48-h time point? Our data demonstrated that viral capture was extremely fast and the virus became trypsin-resistant in less than 5 min irrespective of the presence or absence of bNAbs. Therefore, the bNAbs must have exerted their inhibitory activity subsequent to viral capture. Future studies examining the mechanism of activity on viral replication of primary viruses could further our understanding of these bNAbs. Our studies further showed that although the bNAbs do not inhibit capture, their presence during capture is essential for subsequent inhibition of viral entry and replication. In fact, for maximum inhibition, the bNAb must be in contact with the virus before exposure to cells. If the bNAb was added just 2 min after the addition of virus to cells, only partial inhibition (50%) of viral replication was observed at 48 h (Fig. 5D), compared to over 90% inhibition if the bNAb was added before addition of virus to cells (Figs. 3B, 5B). If however, the bNAb was added 5 min after exposure of the virus to the cells, then only ~20% inhibition was observed (Fig. 5D). Thus, once the virus was captured, if it was not already associated with the bNAb, the virus became refractory to the antibody and escaped inhibition even if the bNAbs were present subsequently in the external medium. The second unexpected finding was that pseudoviruses and IMCs exhibited a distinct capture phenotype. Unlike the primary viruses, the capture of pseudoviruses and IMCs was significantly inhibited by bNAbs. This might be due to differences in the structure and composition of the envelopes of these viruses. The primary viruses produced from PBMCs through multiple rounds of viral infection consist of a pool of heterogenous quasispecies. On the other hand, pseudoviruses and IMCs produced by a single round of virus assembly from 293 T cells are a relatively homogenous population. In addition, there might be differences in the glycosylation patterns of the envelopes produced by the two different cell systems. Finally, differences in the presence of other host proteins on the surface of the virion due to budding from the host cell cannot be excluded. We hypothesize a bimodal mechanism that explains our findings and some unexpected findings reported recently (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000) (Fig. 6). The ability of HIV-1 to infect different cell types, some with extremely low levels of CD4, and to remain attached to host cells lacking CD4 receptors during cell-to-cell transmission raises the question if one of the first interactions between the HIV-1 Env trimer and the cell might be a surface molecule other than the CD4 receptor. There is evidence that primary viruses could be captured through cell surface molecules such as α4β7 (Cicala et al., 2011; Guzzo et al., 2017; McKinnon et al., 2011), DC-SIGN (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000), tetraspanins (Connell and Lortat-Jacob, 2013; von Lindern et al., 2003), and Siglec-1 (Jobe et al., 2016). Capture facilitates movement of the virus on the surface and engagement with the CD4 and CCR5 receptors which then leads to internalization, possibly by encapsulation of the complex into an endocytic-type vesicle. The virus is no longer exposed on the cell surface and hence, trypsin-resistant, and undergoes fusion with the host cell membrane and delivery of nucleocapsid into the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig. 6). If the virus is in complex with the bNAb, then one or more steps of the subsequent entry and fusion process will be blocked, consequently inhibiting viral replication. On the other hand, pseudoviruses and IMCs are captured on the cell surface primarily through interaction with the CD4 receptor. Extensive and complex glycosylation of these relatively homogeneous viruses produced by 293 T cells (Croset et al., 2012) may render them less prone to be captured by other attachment molecules. Indeed, differences in glycosylation patterns and varying degrees of infectivity have been noted. The Env of transmitted-founder viruses of subtypes A, C, and D have fewer N-linked glycosylation sites (Derdeyn et al., 2004; Joseph et al., 2015; Sagar et al., 2009), and a bias towards transmission of poorly glycosylated subtype C viruses in female to male transmission has been reported (Ping et al., 2013). In addition, there might be differences in the structure and conformation of the envelope trimer. The trimers of a pseudovirus or IMC might exist in a closed state, which is CD4 dependent (White et al., 2010), whereas those in a primary virus are in a dynamic state sampling different conformations. These various aspects of primary viruses versus pseudoviruses and IMCs require further investigation. Our findings will have important implications to mechanisms of HIV-1 transmission and design of effective HIV-1 vaccines: First, our results show that rapid capture might be one of the mechanisms used by primary HIV-1 during sexual transmission. Based on our results, this would limit the window of time for the availability of the virus to antibodies to ~2 min. This means that, even if potent bNAbs were present at the site of exposure, a small but significant portion of viruses might escape inhibition. These might be sufficient to establish early reservoirs (Whitney et al., 2014). Indeed, in preliminary experiments using the highly potent 3BNC117 antibody at saturating concentration (10 µg/mL) (90% inhibition), we found that at 96 h after infection, ~12,000 gag RNA copies were present in the cells (Fig. S5A) and ~40,000 gag RNA copies in the supernatant (Fig. S5B), roughly double the numbers present at 48 h (Figs. S5A and S5B). These may represent viruses that escaped the inhibition by the mAb, some of which were replication competent and subsequently released progeny viruses into the supernatant. Recent data from in vivo challenge experiments are also consistent with our analyses. NHPs inoculated with a “sterilizing” concentration of PGT121 (2 mg/kg) (Moldt et al., 2012) followed by challenge with SHIV-SF162P3 did not show any viremia in the blood, as predicted. However, various organs including the female reproductive tract, bone marrow, and spleen were positive for viral RNA and DNA at 1, 3, and 7 days post infection. Transfer of spleen cells 7 days after challenge into naive hosts resulted in replication competent infectious virus production in the new host demonstrating that the bNAb did not completely prevent virus transmission at the mucosal port of entry (Liu et al., 2016). These unexpected in vivo findings seem to show that although bNAbs were effective in blocking transmission and viral replication, they did not do so completely, which in part might have been due to escape during the capture phase and subsequent replication. Second, we infer from our results that it might be necessary to elicit capture-blocking antibodies in addition to bNAbs in order to completely block HIV-1 transmission. Capture-blocking antibodies, by interfering with the initial attachment of the virus with the host cell, would minimize bNAb escape. In the RV144 vaccine trial, the only trial that showed 31% vaccine efficacy, elicitation of certain V2 domain-specific binding antibodies correlated with protection (Haynes et al., 2012). This correlation of protection was also recapitulated in the macaque SHIV challenge model (Pegu et al., 2013). The V1V2 domain positioned at the tips of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein spikes has been implicated in binding to the cell surface molecules such as α4β7 (Cicala et al., 2011; Guzzo et al., 2017; McKinnon et al., 2011), DC-SIGN (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000), and Siglec-1 (Jobe et al., 2016). Furthermore, a primatized anti-α4β7 mAb provided significant protection against SHIV challenge in macaque models (Byrareddy et al., 2016). SIV-infected macaques on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) did not show viral rebound and maintained normal CD4+ T cell counts after ART was withdrawn if the animals were previously administered the mAb (Byrareddy et al., 2016). Thus, collectively, the evidence is compelling to suggest that antibodies that block capture may have a significant impact on blunting HIV-1 infection. A combination of capture blocking and bNAbs could therefore completely prevent HIV-1 transmission and establishment of early reservoirs. Finally, in view of the promiscuity of HIV-1 tropism and its ability for cell-to-cell transmission, our studies highlight the importance of a quantitative, kinetically controlled, high throughput assay using primary virus isolates to complement traditional neutralization assays. It would allow evaluation of the effectiveness of antibodies to prevent initial viral capture as well as subsequent viral entry and replication, both of which might be essential in order for a prophylactic vaccine to completely block HIV-1 acquisition during sexual transmission.

FS causes several harmful diseases if not properly managed (al-Ghazali and al-Azawi, 1990; Bracken and Ysunza, 2005; Jiang et al., 2002). Approximately 2.5 billion people globally do not have access to adequate sanitation facilities (UN, 2012), and more than 0.7 billion people globally lacked access to clean water because the water is polluted by people's own feces (UN, 2012). A study revealed that about 1800 children die every day due to diseases associated with inadequate hygiene, lack of sanitation, and contaminated water (UNICEF, 2013). To address these issues, the millennium development goal (MDG) target aimed to reduce the 2.5 billion people without adequate sanitation in half by 2015. Unfortunately, this target was not feasible at the end of 2015. Considering that the world's population is expected to reach 9.6 billion in 2050, a suitable method for dealing with FS, especially on the processes that enable the sustainable and efficient recovery of resources, should be developed (UN, 2012; Yemaneh, 2015). In the past few years, dry and low water sanitation has gained worldwide attention with the concept that FS can be directly processed at the point of recovery or collected and transported to the point of treatment (Mackie Jensen et al., 2008; Verbyla et al., 2016; Yemaneh et al., 2012). Several products, such as fertilizers, biofuels, water, biogas and compost, can be recovered after treatment (Bracken and Ysunza, 2005; Jepsen et al., 1997; World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO) and (UNICEF), 2014). Several methods have been introduced to successfully treat FS for hygienic end-product for re-use or disposal (Allievi et al., 1994; Anderson et al., 2015a; Factura et al., 2011; Feachem, 1983; Magri et al., 2015). Lactic acid fermentation (LAF) has been reported to successfully suppressed pathogens in FS and organic material preservation (Anderson et al., 2015b). LAF is a metabolic process in which lactic acid fermenting organisms (LAB) easily metabolize degradable carbohydrates to lactic acid. LAB have the capability to convert carbohydrates to lactic acid, and the genera Leuconostic, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus are used for food preservation by fermentation industries and sanitation agencies (Vandenbergh, 1993). The reduction of pH during lactic acid fermentation and the production of antimicrobial compounds are effective natural and cheap processes to effectively eliminate non-desirable microorganisms and pathogens when applied for hygienization (Noike et al., 2002). Lactic acid reduces the bulk pH of the surrounding medium that influences the activity of membrane-bound enzymes and exo-enzymes (Anderson et al., 2015b). In addition, the capability of lactic acid to suppress pathogens is partially attributed to its capability to penetrate the cytoplasmic membrane of microorganisms in the associated form, which results in the decline on intracellular pH of pathogens. Zhu et al. (2006) reported that the survival of pathogens pH was reduced at pH less than 3.5 although the suppression of bacteria requires a pH of less than 2.5. Therefore, the key antimicrobial property of lactic acid is the capability to suppress the intracellular of bacteria (Anderson et al., 2015b). Scheinemann et al. (2015) reported that bacteria pathogens, such as E. coli, salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus were eliminated from cow manure after few days of fermentation. Anderson et al. (2015b) also reported that fecal coliform and E. coli were reduced below detection limit within 1 week of FS treatment with LAB created through the mixture of fermented milk that contained lactobacillus casei and pasteurized whole milk. Although several studies have been conducted to investigate the sanitizing potential of lactic acid within the food industry (Anderson et al., 2015b; Mante et al., 2003), studies that focused on the sanitizing potential of lactic acid on pathogens present in FS are limited. In addition, no concrete studies have been conducted to compare the efficiency of LAF of FS. An experiment was conducted in this study to compare the LAF treatment efficiency of FS with LAF materials, namely, lactobacillus strain of LAB, fermented cassava flour, and fermented rice flour. The results served as the foundation for the research on producing effective, cheap and easy to use LAF for safe application or disposal of FS hygienization. FS was collected from the septic tank of the University of Science and Technology, Beijing. The initial characteristics are shown in Table 1. FS was collected from the septic tank at the same day of fermentation with the prepared lactic acids to avoid the changes in microbial communities and pH variation. FS was transported to the laboratory in a 10 L bucket. In the laboratory, a suction pump was used to fill each of the four 5 L buckets with approximately 1 kg for control bucket, 1 kg for bucket marked with 1:1 of FS and lactobacillus, 1 kg for the bucket with 1:1 of FS and fermented cassava flour, and 1 kg for bucket marked with 1:1 of FS and fermented rice flour. Each of the buckets was designated as reactors 1–4. Prior to the commencement of the stabilization experiments, 50 g of raw FS was used for the analysis on physical and microbial properties. The indicator organism, fecal coliform, was used to assess the overall sanitation efficiency of various fermentations. Serial dilution of the fecal sample was conducted in deionized water for microbial test. Fecal coliform count was determined using a membrane method with coliform agar, followed by incubation at 48 °C for 24 h. The current approach for lactic acid production uses food waste and agricultural products. The three materials used were distinguished into different materials. Lactobacillus strain and cassava were classified as starch materials, and rice was classified as cellulose products. All the three fermentations lasted for 6 d. The initial volume of lactobacillus used was 40 mL, cultured every 24 h, and was enlarged to the required volume of 1 L with the addition of deionized water for the period of 6 d at room temperature for the LAB to grow to a large quantity before mixing with FS for the treatment process. For the fermentation in cassava flour, dry cassava flour was soaked with deionized water and was allowed to ferment for a period of 6 d. The main stages involved in the lactic acid production from fermented rice flour included steaming, soaking, extruding, boiling, cooling, and fermenting. Soaking is important for the production of fermented rice flour because it increases the water content of rice and enhances natural fermentation. pH values of 4.2, 3.8, and 3.4 were achieved from lactobacillus, fermented cassava flour, and fermented rice flour on the 6th day of fermentation. Fig. 1 shows the LAF process of lactobacillus, fermented cassava flour, and fermented rice flour. The total solid content of initial FS and after treatment were assessed using the 2540E standard method for wastewater examination. The LAF treatment process was monitored by measuring the concentration and accumulation of lactic acid bacteria and pH variation. The use of lactic acid for the inactivation of fecal coliform was conducted by evaluating the survival rates of pathogens through a total viable plate count method and pH changes during the treatment process. LAB was cultured using a pour plate technique on lactobacillus select agar and were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The total viable counts of bacteria colonies on solidified agar plates using chromogenic agar technique were used to measure the level of fecal coliform suppression. The fecal coliform count was determined using the membrane method with coliform agar, followed by incubation at 48 °C for 24 h. The treatment period was set as the time required for fecal coliforms to appear on the agar. The number of fecal coliforms (CFU/100 mL) was determined for each analyzed sample by using Chromocult® Coliform agar. The culture media was prepared using standardized protocols and reagents under sterile conditions. This process was conducted in an electric oven operated aerobically. The pH values during the treatment processes were determined by taking 10 g of sample from each reactor that was dissolved in 100 mL distilled water. The dissolved portions were stirred for 15 min. After settling, the liquid portion was measured through potentiometric measurement using standard pH electrode. To determine the lactic acid content and production efficiency of LAF from fermented materials and their fermentation efficiency when applied in LAF of FS, the community composition and dynamics of LAB associated with lactobacillus, cassava flour, and rice flour fermentation were investigated by using a culture-dependent approach. Single strain of the fermentation materials (i.e., Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus amylovorus, and Lactobacillus Sp.) was isolated. The results showed that Lactobacillus Sp., which was a strain from fermented rice flour, produced high lactic acid content compared to cassava flour and lactobacillus. Furthermore, the lactic acid production efficiency of fermented rice flour was higher than that of cassava flour and lactobacillus, as shown in Table 2. This result revealed that fermented rice flour can be an effective substrate for LAF of FS for pathogen reduction and odor control due to its efficiency in producing high amounts of lactic acid during fermentation. A comprehensive analysis on fermentation aids in devising strategies to improve the quality of LAF of FS. pH variation in the treatment process is an important parameter that should be considered in LAF experiments because it determines the acidity and alkalinity of fermentation (Anderson et al., 2015a; Factura et al., 2011; Feachem, 1983). pH was used in this experiment to evaluate and compare the fermentation efficiency from various treatment processes. Result showed that the single strain of LAB (lactobacillus) was able to reduce the pH of treatment processes to 5.8 when initially mixed with FS in equal ratio and declined to 5.2–5.4 throughout the period of the experiment, and the control pH remained at nearly the same level, as shown in Fig. 2a. This study revealed that a single strain of LAB cannot effectively suppress pH variation in FS. The acidity of FS influences the rate of change in pH, which determines the amount of lactic acid present in fermentation and the effective sanitization. Thiamann (1963) stated that for lactic acid fermentation to be effective in sanitization, a final pH of approximately 4.0 should be achieved. However, this study showed that effective sanitation process depended on the initial low pH value of lactic acid and the survival rate of LAB when added to FS. The initial pH value of the cultivated lactobacillus was 4.2 before adding to FS. However, the process did not suppress the pH to below 5.4. In the reactor that contained fermented cassava flour and feces, the pH value reduced to 7.5 few hours after mixture with FS and was reduced to 6.0 on the 5th and 7th day. The pH value of the system started increasing on the 10th day and remained high throughout the remaining period of the experiment, as shown in Fig. 2b. A final pH of 7.8 was observed. According to Sanni et al. (2013), fermented cassava produced LAB, such as Pediococcus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus. However, no significant decline in pH toward acidification was observed when fermented cassava was applied for the sanitization of FS in this study. This finding may be due to the lack of supplement sugar source to keep the produced LAB active during the treatment process. Kamra and Srivastava (1994) reported that the application of LAF for fermentable substances requires sugar supplements. FS does not contain easily degradable sugar, and easily degradable sugar supplements are required to enhance the growth of LAB during fermentation with LAF materials (Lopez Zavala et al., 2004). In the third reactor that contained fermented rice flour and FS, the pH value reduced to 6.6 on the first day of mixture and reduced to 3.9 on the 7th day of fermentation. The pH value stabilized from the 10th day to the final day of treatment with the pH value that ranged between 3.7 and 3.9, as shown in Fig. 2c. The decline and stability in pH showed that fermented rice flour can produce LAB capable of suppressing pathogens. This finding implied that fermented rice flour could be an effective lactic acid conditioner for pathogen inactivation in FS because pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, coliform and Salmonella spp., rarely survive in acidic environment with low pH (Glaser and Guggenberger, 2001). pH reduction is an important aspect of hygienization and preservation-oriented LAF process (UNICEF, 2013). In this study, only reactor mixed with rice flour and feces was able to reduce pH of the treatment process to the suitable acidification range. On the basis of previous studies, assessing the efficiency of treatment processes in FS fermentation is expensive and requires rigorous labor to measure all types of available pathogens (Strande et al., 2014). Thus, an indicator organism should be selected to measure the pathogenic activity during fermentation to indicate the amount of eliminated pathogens during the entire treatment process (Chahal et al., 2016; Feachem, 1983; Strande et al., 2014). Fecal coliform was used in this experiment as the only indicator organism to evaluate and compare the treatment efficiency of produced lactobacillus in the laboratory, fermented cassava flour, and fermented rice flour for pathogen inactivation in FS. The results showed that lactobacillus was able to slightly reduce fecal coliform concentration to 1.1 × 108 CFU/100 mL after 5 h of fermentation with FS, and fecal coliform count of 1.6 × 108 CFU/100 mL was recorded from the control reactor at the same time. Interestingly, fecal coliform count at the final day of treatment in the fermentation reactor was more than the one recorded from the control reactor. Final fecal coliform of 8.6 × 108 CFU/100 mL was recorded from the fermentation, and 1.16 × 108 CFU/100 mL was recorded from the control reactor. The results are calculated and converted to log108 CFU/100 mL and are presented in Fig. 3a. This result revealed that lactobacillus only cannot completely eliminate the pathogens in FS. Results from the reactor that contained cassava flour and FS showed that the process was only able to reduce fecal coliform content to 1.8 × 108 CFU/100 mL within 5 h of treatment compared to 2.2 × 108 CFU/100 mL observed from the control reactor. Fecal coliform of 2.4 × 108 CFU/100 mL was achieved on the final day of treatment. The results are converted to log10 CFU/100 mL and are presented in Fig. 3b. The incapability of fermented cassava flour to completely inactivate bacteria pathogens in the FS may be due to the incapability of the process to reduce the pH of the system to acidic state. The sanitation indicator bacteria were reduced to 0.6 × 108 CFU/100 mL in the reactor that contained fermented rice flour and feces within 1st 5 h period with the indicator reactor that had fecal coliform count of 3.1 × 108 CFU/100 mL. The sanitation indicator bacteria were completely eliminated on the 15th day of fermentation. The results are converted to log10 CFU/100 mL and are presented in Fig. 3c. The total elimination of fecal coliform in this process may be attributed to the low pH value achieved from the process because a previous study reported that LAF process that achieved a final pH value of 3.5–4.2 efficiently eliminated a range of pathogens. The final pH achieved in the fermentation with rice flour was within 3.7–3.9. Apart from the stable reduction in pH, other factors may have played a vital role in fermented rice flour that contributed in eliminating bacteria pathogens in the FS. Li et al. (2015) reported that fermented rice flour produces abundant LAB and yeast. This condition may contribute in suppressing bacteria pathogens in FS. However, other antimicrobial compounds, such as hydrogen peroxide, diacetyl, and bacteriocins are reported to be produced by LAB during fermentation, which also play important roles on pathogen elimination in the fermentation system (Mackie Jensen et al., 2008; Verbyla et al., 2016; Yemaneh et al., 2012). Considering that LAB in fermented rice flour remained active throughout the experiment, the hygienization method showed more effectiveness than fermented cassava flour and lactobacillus bacteria because fecal coliform was reduced to half compared with the control reactor within one week and were completely inactivated within two weeks. The final plate count from the treatment processes is presented in Fig. 4. The method used in this study reduced fecal coliform more efficiently than the lime treatment, ammonia treatment, and composting process. Liu (2016) confirmed that enterococci and coliform were reduced during composting within a period of months, but traces of residual concentrations were still observed in the mature compost. This method conserved the nutrients during the processing of FS effectively due to the absence of self-heating technique and the minimal production of gas. Food supply through agriculture should be improved by using sanitized FS as soil conditioner in the growing global population. However, the direct use of lacto-fermented feces to agriculture may be constrained by high concentrations of organic acids, insufficient hygienization, and incomplete decomposition. Post-treatment by vermin-composting, thermophilic composting and the addition of biochar stabilize and sanitize the material before its application in agriculture. Odor evaluation by panel of observers indicates that the fecal odor is not suppressed from the treatment process and the control for experiments with lactobacillus and FS. For the experiments with the mixture of fermented cassava flour and FS (1:1 W/W), fecal odor is suppressed and replaced by cassava flour smell. For the treatment with the combination of fermented rice flour with FS (1:1 W/W), the fecal odor is suppressed and is replaced by sour smell. From the results of different monitored processes for LAF experiments of lactobacillus, fermented cassava flour, and fermented rice flour, the LAF of rice flour indicates better odor suppression efficiency compared with other LAF sources used in the study. Therefore, fermented rice flour played an important role in odor control for effective LAF of FS. In this study, the treatment efficiency of LAF processes for pathogen inactivation in FS was conducted among LAB potential materials, namely, lactobacillus, fermented cassava flour, and fermented rice flour. The results showed that only fermented rice flour effectively inactivated the indicator organism (fecal coliform). The final pH values of 5.4, 7.8, and 3.9 were achieved from lactobacillus, fermented cassava flour, and fermented rice flour, respectively. The results indicated that acidification during fermentation played a vital role in pathogen elimination, because only rice flour was able to reduce the pH of the process toward acidification state. This study revealed that not all LAF materials had sufficient native lactic acid fermenting microorganisms that can effectively suppress bacteria pathogens in FS and several LAB potential materials required additives, such as sugar, to keep the process active. Therefore, proper pretreatment test should be conducted to select a suitable method for LAF on the effective acidification of FS for pathogen elimination.\",\n"," 'Coal as one of the major fossil fuels plays an important role in the development of commerce and industry, and as such, it impacts man’s daily life profoundly. It has been estimated that nearly 42% of the world’s electricity is generated by the burning of coal [1]. Coal-related research has received sustained and wide-spread attention in the past, and in recent years it has witnessed a resurgence with the diminishing reserves as well as the ever-increasing demand. However, large-scale extraction of coal remains for the most part a hazardous undertaking. Along with cave-ins and coal dust fire and explosion, methane gas explosion and water in-rush represent the ultimate hazards in today’s coalmines [2], which threaten life and property on a daily basis. While a slow accumulation of methane and water can be detected and safety measures taken in time, sudden appearance of methane and water due to inadvertent drilling in coalmine tunnels have claimed thousands of lives and disrupted production worldwide in the last few years alone. To prevent such accident from occurring, a look-ahead device that can penetrate rocks, soil, and coal and forewarn the presence of water and methane gas in large quantity is needed. At present, such a device does not exist. While technologies have advanced enormously, and several candidates for such a purpose look promising, such as ground penetrating radar, transient electromagnetic method, electrical conductivity/resistivity measurement, and ultrasonic wave devices, a reliable working device is still years away [3]. Recently, our laboratory has been engaged in the research and development of a low-terahertz (THz), i.e., W-band electromagnetic wave imaging Radar which measures resonances in the absorption of the THz radiation by water molecules and CH4 molecules in order to detect the presence of pockets of water and/or methane gas up to several meters through rock, soil, and coal, from the radar receiving antenna. The design of such a THz device requires the fundamental grasp of physical properties of coal, especially its complex dielectric permittivity (including real and imaginary parts of it, corresponding to the index of refraction, and loss/attenuation, respectively). It is therefore of great importance to study dielectric characteristics of electromagnetic waves propagating in coal. While such studies have been carried out to some extent in the RF and microwave frequency bands, in conjunction with work on ground penetrating radar and transient electromagnetic methods [4–7], to date no work has been done in the required W-band and beyond. In fact, with the development of microelectronics technology, more sophisticated apparatus and instruments became available for measurement of the dielectric properties of coal in the last decade. Some factors affecting the permittivity of coal such as rank, anisotropy, pyrite concentration and distribution, moisture content, temperature and mineral matter concentration were investigated in the past few years [8–19]. However, the electrical complex permittivity measurements of coals in THz band are not yet available. The present study is undertaken to attempt to fill this void. THz wave is an electromagnetic wave that occupies a middle spectral region between microwaves and infrared light waves (wavelength ranges from 0.03 mm to 3 mm). The research of THz has received a great deal of attention in recent years [20–25]. THz technology has been widely applied in a number of areas such as molecular recognition (many vibration modes of complex and biological molecules lie in the THz range) [21], security screening and non-destructive analysis of materials. As the transmitted frequency of radar reaches millimeter wave and THz band, numerous physical, chemical and biological systems have clear absorption spectral features in the THz region. In addition, water is strongly absorptive of THz radiation. Therefore, utilizing these characteristics to study the dielectric properties of coals in the THz band can help solve some problems for design of penetrating ground radar in different frequency band. In this paper, we investigate the effects of THz radiation in the frequency range from 75 GHz to 110 GHz and the moisture content on the dielectric permittivity of anthracite and bituminous coals commonly found in China by using the free space method. As one of the non-resonant methods, and unlike the open-ended probe [18,19] and resonant cavity methods, the free space method has been widely used for many years [26–35]. It has many advantages over other resonant methods and open-ended probes methods: (1) it is particularly attractive for nondestructive test in some construction industry for its noncontact modality [26]; (2) it only requires moderate sample preparation since the sample can be sufficiently large to reduce edge diffraction effects and thin sample may induce sagging effect; (3) in order to improve accuracy of measurements, its calibration method is simple compared with other methods; (4) it is very convenient to test the relationship of coal permittivity with temperature since resonant method and open-ended probes are limited in waveguide and require more complex system structure for temperature determination. Last but not least, using the free space method together with the new millimeter/submillimeter wave Agilent measurement technology and the Virginia Diode Inc (VDI) extension modules [36], it is possible to extend the measuring frequency of the coal dielectric properties to the terahertz (THz) band. The quantity PD is used to describe the distance from the material surface where the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation falls to 1/e of its value at the surface. In general, measured magnitudes of the real and imaginary part in Eq. (1) are relatively low, and the two parts in Eq. (1) are usually re-scaled by dividing them with the permittivity of free space (ɛ0 = 8.85 ∗ 10−12 F/m), the resultant quantities are termed the real and imaginary parts of the relative complex permittivity. Fig. 1a shows a schematic of the dielectric measurement system setup in the THz band by using the free space method. The THz signal is generated by the extension module1 and transmitted by a conical horn antenna, and received by a matching conical horn antenna and the extension module2. A pair of spot-focusing lens with diameter 25.4 mm is used to spot-focus the THz transmitting signal on the coal sample, with a focal length of 25 mm. Available extension modules cover the frequency range from 75 GHz to 500 GHz in a number of frequency bands, with matching conical horn antennas for each frequency band, i.e. 75–110 GHz, 140–220 GHz, 220–330 GHz, and 325–500 GHz. Both the transmitted and received signals are connected with a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). The scattering parameters (S11 and S21) can be calculated using software provided with the VNA (Agilent 85071E). Here we utilize the frequency band from 75 to 110 GHz as the measurement frequency for the time being, and will extend into higher-frequency bands in the near future. The sample holder is mounted on a guide rail to adjust the distance of coal sample from the transmitting conical horn antenna, which is shown in Fig. 1b. The variable position of the coal sample holder is controlled by a step motor in 1 μm increment. Before the actual measurement is undertaken, a calibration based on the “Thru”, “Reflect” and “Line” (TRL) standard is performed to reduce measurement error that might be caused by multiple reflections, other noise and diffraction. Fig. 1c shows the schematic of the TRL calibration for free space. The calibration steps are all automated and divided into three. Firstly, set a distance between the two coaxial horns and measure the thru using the VNA. To measure the reflect, the two horn antennas must be moved back by the thickness of the standard metal plate. The separation distance between the antennas is set as 0.75 mm (quarter wavelength at 100 GHz). The line standard is then realized by precisely moving the two horn antennas back again. Finally, the antenna needs to be precisely moved back to the original position. Another application of the reflect standard is to only move a metal plate to the calibration planes for reflection measurements. In addition, a time-domain gating technique is used to eliminate the multiple reflections of antennas and ambient reflections. A variety of coal samples were selected from Shandong bituminous and Shanxi anthracite coals, and their proximate and ultimate analyses [38] are shown in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. All the bulk coal samples were obtained from large blocks of coals taken directly from their native mines. Using a cleaver and a saw, along with sandpapers, all the samples were fashioned into cubic shape with 70 mm in length. The assessment of composition of the bulk coals is complicated due to the complexity of natural coal samples and the difficulties of measuring the moisture content, for example. During the experiment each sample was put on a shelf and placed in a baking furnace. The baking furnace has the capability of operating at the maximum of 300 °C. The residual content of moisture in the coal samples was measured periodically by taking out the shelf after being held at the temperature 250 °C for 90 min and weighing on a digital balance (BSM5200, with a precision of 0.001 g). Repeat steps (1) and (2) until RD falls below 0.1%; (3) Put the coal sample into a humidifier to get the required moisture content. It should be noted that humidifying the coal sample requires several days. In addition, the measurement must be carried out immediately after the completion of step (3) to avoid the environmental effects on the measurement results. The magnitude of the measured S11 with time-domain gating is shown in Fig. 2 after the TRL calibration. We considered the magnitude of S11 when there is coal sample and without, respectively. From the measured data, the magnitude of S11 is less than −40 dB, which is in agreement with previously obtained result [34]. The result demonstrated that the TRL calibration has a high accuracy for determining the complex s-parameters of coal. Both the measured real and imaginary part of bituminous coals exhibits lower values than those of the anthracite coals. The decreasing trend of the dielectric constant of Shanxi anthracite coals is more precipitous compared with that of the Shandong bituminous coals. The probable reason is the effect of different volatile matter or ash component content on the dielectric property of coals from anthracite to bituminous coals. The variation for anthracite and bituminous coals are coincidence with previous investigation from [17]. It can be seen from above results that lower rank coals have higher dielectric constant values than higher rank coals in the measured frequency band. The decreasing trend of relative dielectric constant coincides with previous work in the lower frequency band [15]. It is clear that there will not be significant contributions from the terms χi and χe because the frequencies involved in the present measurement are far below the resonant frequencies of the ionic and electronic processes. In addition, coal samples treated in the frequency range excite very little space-charge contributions. With increasing frequency especially when 90 ⩽ f ⩽ 110 GHz (Fig. 3b), the dipolar polarizations involving the bound charges in the coal sample will be enhanced with increasing external electric field. Under such conditions, the strengthened dipolar term χd, representing the dissipation of energy with the relaxation of it, is considered as the dominant term in determining the decreasing trend of complex permittivity of coal with variation of frequency as shown in Fig. 3, rather than χs. The formulas show that there is a simple relationship between dielectric properties of coals and frequency f, |R|, |T| and the thickness of the sample. |R| of both bituminous and anthracite coals exhibits a dramatically decreasing trend with increasing frequency, while |T| shows a first slightly decreasing and then increasing trend as a function of increasing frequency. The bituminous coals have lower |R| (0.21 ⩽ |R| ⩽ 0.26) than anthracite coals (0.31 ⩽ |R| ⩽ 0.34), while |T| is about ten times that of the anthracite coals. With regards to |T|, as expected, the value depends on the thickness of the coal for the same coal type. The lower |T| shows that only little electromagnetic wave propagate through the whole sample. The variation of |R| for both anthracite and bituminous coals is predicated mainly on the variation of the real part of the complex permittivity. On the other hand, the variation of |T| can be explained as follows: when frequency increases, the dissipation of the electromagnetic energy in coals increases as expected, leading to the decrease of |T|. In this process, we note that the variation of |R| is monotonic (decreasing gradually with frequency). And with the continuously increasing frequency, the absorbed electromagnetic energy in the samples increases. Therefore, the decrease of reflection coefficient and the increase of absorbed energy in coal lead to the slight increase of the |T| when f > 90GHz (Figs. 4b and 5b). Here we invoke the relation that the sum of the reflected, transmitted, and absorbed power equal to unity when scaled with the input power. The dielectric properties of selected bituminous and anthracite coal samples vs. moisture content are shown in Fig. 7. It is obvious that the real part increases significantly with increasing moisture content for both the bituminous and anthracite coals. The imaginary part of selected coal samples has a similar tendency with moisture content variation (Fig. 7b and d). Fig. 7a shows that the real part values of selected bituminous sampling coals increase from 2.33 to 2.78 with moisture content increasing from 0% to 10%. Similar results are also obtained with anthracite coals of which the real part varies from 3.39 to 3.88 with the same moisture content variation (shown in Fig. 7c). A comparison of Fig. 7a and c reveals that anthracite coals have relatively higher real part values than bituminous coals with moisture content variation in the 110 GHz band. However, the real part values of selected coal samples within the same coal type exhibits certain degree of overlap and cross-over. For instance, coal F has a higher real part value than coal I with moisture content below 2.5%, and a lower value for moisture content beyond 2.5%. These observations show that the moisture of the coal samples plays an important role in the dielectric properties of anthracite and bituminous coals in the low THz band. The ultimate explanation is attributed to the strong effect of water on THz wave propagation. The moisture–frequency dependence of the complex dielectric permittivity derives mainly from the frequency characteristics of molecular interaction of water with the THz radiation, and the latter is well documented [41]. The detailed fitness parameters are given in Table 4. There is no substantial difference for those parameters between the bituminous coals and the anthracite coals. In other words, the reflection coefficients depend primarily on the surface characteristics of the coal samples, and only secondarily on the internal structure and composition of the coals. Using Eq. (3), the penetration depth of coals with increasing moisture content is calculated at 110 GHz, and the results are shown in Fig. 10. As expected, when the moisture content increases, the penetration depth decreased dramatically. The behavior of the reflection coefficient as a function of sample moisture content bespeaks the influence of two competing factors. As we have seen so far that the real part and imaginary part of the dielectric constant both increase as moisture content increases. The former is related to the index of refraction and the latter to absorption, as demonstrated by Tanno et al. [42] who estimated water content in coal and obtained THz transmittance spectra of raw and dried coal. The index of refraction enters consideration through the Fresnel reflection at the air-sample interface, which should account for the initial increase of the reflection. However, as moisture content increases further, absorption by the sample becomes dominant, which exponentially increases as moisture content increases. This indirectly suppresses reflection as well as transmission, which should be the dominant factor for moisture content beyond about 5%, irrespective of the types of coal samples, as seen in Fig. 8. The fundamental reason for the differences between the variation of transmission and reflection coefficient with water content is attributed to the state of the water in the coal. It is well known that several forms of water exist in coals, which are classified into five types [43]: surface adsorption water, adhesion water, interior adsorbed water, capillary water, and interparticle water. With the increase of moisture content, there exist a great number of free water molecules at the surface of the coal sample. The free water can readily respond to the external THz wave, so we can see the drastic decrease of the transmission coefficient with increasing moisture content in Fig. 8. In addition, the bituminous coals have relatively higher transmission coefficient than the anthracite coals with the same moisture content, since there exists much porosity [44] in bituminous coals than in anthracite coals. Such pore structures can be considered as air cavity whose permittivity is almost one. This means THz wave can penetrate the bituminous coals more easily than the anthracite coals. Therefore, the transmission coefficient of the bituminous coals is much greater than the anthracite coals (Figs. 4b and 5b). For the reflection coefficient variation of coals shown in Fig. 9, the bound water in the coal plays a major role in the increasing part of R with moisture content below 4.5%. This is because the bound water cannot respond to the THz radiation. Next we consider the free water, with continuous increase of moisture content, the associated increase of free water leads to the decrease of reflection coefficient due to the increase of THz wave attenuation in the samples. On the other hand, we have concluded that the real and imaginary part of the complex dielectric permittivity of both anthracite and bituminous coals increase with the increase of free water, as shown in Fig. 7. THz dielectric properties of Shandong bituminous and Shanxi anthracite coals, from two of the major coal producing regions of China, were studied for the first time, employing a free space THz measurement system. Effects of moisture content on the dielectric properties of selected coals in the THz frequency range from 75 GHz to 110 GHz have been investigated experimentally. The experimental results show that the complex dielectric constant of selected anthracite and bituminous coals decreases considerably with increasing frequency from 75 GHz to 110 GHz. In this frequency range, the anthracite coals exhibit higher values of real and imaginary part than the bituminous coals. The imaginary part of the coal samples exhibits a more significantly decreasing trend in the frequency range from 90 GHz to 110 GHz than that in the frequency region below 90 GHz. In addition, the decreasing trend of the real and imaginary part of the samples is coal-type dependent. It is also observed, for the same coal type at the same frequency, the higher the moisture content, the higher the real and imaginary part values. The variation trend of dielectric properties of selected coal samples with moisture content is also investigated. The real part and imaginary part of bituminite and anthracite coals increase sharply with increasing moisture content from 0% to 10% at the frequency 110 GHz, as expected. The effect of moisture on the dielectric properties of coals in turn affects substantially the transmission and reflection of THz wave propagation in the coal samples. The results show that the transmission coefficient of anthracite and bituminous seems to exhibit an exponentially decreasing trend with increasing moisture content from 0% to 10%. On the other hand, the reflection coefficient of coals exhibits a Gaussian-like trend with increasing moisture content, reaching a peak value around 5% moisture content, irrespective of the coal types. Such a behavior can be understood in terms of the different roles played by the bound and free water in interaction with the THz radiation, and the interplay between the Fresnel reflection of the THz wave at the air-coal interface, and the propagation loss through the coal samples.',\n"," \"Enteric viruses are frequently associated with water- and foodborne disease outbreaks. Infected individuals typically shed enteric viruses at very high concentrations and hence these viruses are frequently found in wastewater (Okoh et al., 2010). Most enteric viruses are highly resistant to UV and chemical disinfection, therefore the methods routinely used in wastewater treatment plants may not greatly reduce the number of infectious viruses in the effluent (Sano et al., 2016) and these may enter the environment. Enteric viruses persist in the environment and often have very low infectious doses, leading to waterborne illness with outbreaks potentially occurring far from the source of contamination. Furthermore, viruses can accumulate in sediment and can be ingested by shellfish destined for human consumption, resulting in foodborne illnesses (Landry et al., 1983; Oliveira et al., 2011). The viruses most commonly associated with waterborne diseases are adenovirus (AdV) group F, enterovirus A-D, hepatitis A and E viruses (HAV and HEV), norovirus genotype I and II (NoVGI and NoVGII), sapovirus genotype I (SaVGI), and rotavirus A (Ashbolt, 2015). In developed countries, the majority of water- and foodborne viral outbreaks, including those related to shellfish, are associated with noroviruses (NoVs) (Bosch et al., 2016; Rodríguez-Lázaro et al., 2012). Recently, other caliciviruses, the sapoviruses (SaVs), which have very similar structure to NoVs have also been shown to cause similar symptoms, mostly in young children. These have also been frequently detected in water and shellfish (Yates, 2014). In less economically developed countries, HAV and HEV are prevalent and, due to frequent global movement of people, these viruses are responsible for sporadic outbreaks worldwide (Dalton et al., 2013; Rodríguez-Lázaro et al., 2012). Due to the rapidly increasing number of cases associated with SaV and HEV worldwide, these viruses are considered emerging viruses (Sayed et al., 2015; Yates, 2014). While members of the caliciviruses, and HAV and HEV cause acute gastroenteritis, there are some enteric viruses, such as adenoviruses (AdVs) that are usually asymptomatic or result in mild illness. Furthermore, some commonly asymptomatic respiratory viruses e.g. polyomaviruses (PyV) are excreted in urine, and the possibility of gastroenteric transmission has been suggested (Bofill-Mas et al., 2001). These viruses circulate in the population and are frequently found in wastewater in high concentrations (Tran et al., 2015). To evaluate the risk of faecal contamination in the environment, indicators, such as coliform bacteria and bacteriophages, are commonly used. However, their presence may not reflect the distribution of enteric viruses (Lin and Ganesh, 2013). Recently, several studies have directly monitored enteric viruses in the environment, mainly focusing on extreme weather events (Hata et al., 2014; Vieira et al., 2017) and on drinking water sources (Grøndahl-Rosado et al., 2014; Iaconelli et al., 2017). The limited number of published spatiotemporal viral monitoring studies is partly due to the lack of reliable, standard methods for the detection of viruses in complex matrices, such as wastewater, river and lake water. In addition, evaluations of public health risk related to viral pollution in water require large volumes of water to be analysed. Traditional filtration methods used for water concentration are not suitable for high volume and/or high turbidity samples due to membrane clogging (Cashdollar and Wymer, 2013). In tangential flow ultrafiltration (TFUF), the filter membrane is parallel to the flow stream, hence only a proportion of the feed stream passes through the membrane (permeate) with the remainder (retentate) recirculating. In many environmental studies, TFUF approaches are used as they are superior for the filtration of high turbidity lake and seawater samples compared to other filtration-based methods (Francy et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2014). Due to their sensitivity, accuracy and flexibility, PCR-based methods are used for the quantification of viruses, however, these assays only detect a short segment of the genome and the results provide no measure of viral infectivity (Ronnqvist et al., 2014). Furthermore, PCR amplification may be inhibited by organic matter (e.g. humic substances) co-extracted with nucleic acids and hence may give false negative results (Meschke and Sobsey, 1998; Rock et al., 2010). The aim of the current study was to assess the fate and spatial and temporal distribution of several enteric viruses (NoV, SaV, HAV, HEV, AdV and PyV) in wastewater and surface water, along with sediment and shellfish samples derived from areas affected by wastewater contamination. For water concentration, a carefully validated TFUF technique was used coupled with PCR-based assays for virus quantification. To overcome the limitations of PCR-based detection, NoV particle integrity in the environment was also addressed using a capsid integrity assay. In this study, common and emerging RNA viruses (NoVGI and NoVGII, SaVGI, HAV and HEV) along with potential enteric virus indicators (human AdVs and two common PyV strains: BK and JC) were tested. Samples were spiked with approx. 106 mengovirus (MgV) particles, which is commonly used as a molecular process control to validate nucleic acid extraction and q(RT)-PCR. For method validation, 10 L of surface water samples were spiked with approx. 106 selected enteric virus particles (NoVGII, SaVGI, HAV, HEV and AdV type40). The AdV40 (PHE-0108056v) cultured in HEK293 was kindly provided by Lydia Drumwright (University of Cambridge). The MgV strain VMC0 and HAV strain pHM17543c were kindly provided by Dr. James Lowther (Centre for Environment Fisheries and Aquaculture Science; CEFAS, UK). Sapovirus GI.2 was obtained from clinical stool samples and genotyped by the National Reference Centre for Gastroenteritis Viruses, Dijon, France. The viral sample was generated by the preparation of a 10% solution, using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4), which was subsequently filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. Norovirus sample (diluted and filtered faecal matter from a patient with confirmed NoV GII infection) was provided by Dr. Lydia Drumwright (University of Cambridge, UK). For the validation of the water concentration method, treated and untreated wastewater, river, estuarine and seawater samples were collected in the Conwy River and estuary (North Wales, UK) as shown in Fig. 1. Grab samples were collected at the four major wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Llanrwst and Betws-y-Coed WWTPs discharge to the Conwy and Llugwy rivers, the Llugwy joining the Conwy between Betws-y-Coed and Llanrwst. Tal-y-Bont WWTW discharges to the Conwy estuary. The Betws-y-Coed and Tal-y-Bont WWTPs use activated sludge as secondary treatment and serve ca. 1200 and 1000 inhabitants, respectively. The Llanrwst WWTP uses filter beds for secondary treatment and serves ca. 4000 inhabitants. No disinfection is used prior to discharge at Betws-y-Coed, Llanrwst and Tal-y-Bont WWTPs. The Ganol WWTP, serving ca. 82,000 inhabitants, uses filter beds for secondary treatment followed by UV treatment. Although the treated wastewater from Ganol is discharged to the open sea, combined sewer outflows (CSOs) discharge directly to the Conwy estuary during heavy rainfall events affecting the water quality of the estuary. Mean flow rates are 614 m3/day for Betws-y-Coed, 1142 m3/day for Llanrwst, 763 m3/day for Tal-y-Bont and 19,173 m3/day for Ganol WWTP (data provided by Welsh Water, UK, 2016). By comparison, the median river flows at Betws-y-Coed and Llanrwst WWTWs are 1.15 and 4.81 m3/s, giving indicative flow ratios river/WWTW of ~160 and ~360. Flow measurements for the four WWTPs do not include any release from CSOs as these are not gauged. The exact operation of the WWTPs under high flow conditions is not known with certainty, but each includes holding tanks to accommodate excess influent for later treatment, and CSOs. Under high flow conditions the ratio of river flow to total WWTW effluent is likely to be much greater than the average figures quoted above. At each WWTP, 1 L of influent and effluent samples were collected in duplicates in March 2016, during a local gastroenteritis outbreak. During the outbreak, two care homes with 36 individuals were affected (Public Health Wales, personal communication). However, the number of cases may have been much higher as most patients suffering from NoV do not visit a doctor. For method validation, 40 L of surface water was collected at Betws-y-Coed (river water; SW2), Conwy (estuarine water; SW4) and Penmaenmawr (seawater) at low tide (Fig. 1). For the surveillance of enteric viruses, wastewater, surface water, sediment and shellfish samples were collected from August 2016 to August 2017. Rainfall was observed before/during the sampling of November 2016, January, February, July and August 2017. Wastewater samples, kindly provided by Welsh Water, UK, were collected at the WWTPs described above. At Betws-y-Coed, Llanrwst and Tal-y-Bont, 1 L influent and effluent samples were obtained (BI, BE; LI, LE; TI; TE), whereas at Ganol, 1 L influent samples (GI) were collected. Surface water grab samples of 10 L were collected from the Llugwy (SW1) and Conwy (SW2) rivers at Betws-y-Coed, upstream of the major wastewater treatment plants, at the tidal limit at Llanrwst (SW3) and in the estuary at Conwy (SW4) (Fig. 1). The SW2 samples were taken from a bridge whereas the other surface water samples were taken from the shore. Shellfish samples (SF1 and SF2), 20 blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) of various sizes, were hand-picked at the two commercial shellfish harvesting areas in the estuary. Together with the estuarine water sample and the shellfish samples, 10 g of the top 1 cm layer of sediment was also collected (Sed1, Sed2 and Sed4). All surface water, sediment and shellfish samples were collected at low tide. The pH and turbidity (T) of the wastewater and surface water samples were measured along with the conductivity (K) of the surface water samples. Prior to concentration, MgV was added to the samples as a whole process control. TFUF using 100 kDa mPES MiniKros® hollow fiber filter module with surface area of 790 cm2 with the KrosFlo® Research IIi Tangential Flow Filtration System (Spectrumlabs, USA) was set up. Retentate was collected in a 250 mL reservoir. The system was washed with 2 L MilliQ water, and then a membrane integrity test was performed prior to each experiment according to the manufacturer's instructions. For blocking, the membrane was washed with 1 L of 0.01% sodium polyphosphate as described previously (Hill et al., 2005). After each run, the membrane was washed and disinfected by the circulation of Virkon® solution (Lanxess, Germany) for 5 min. Virkon® was washed out using MilliQ water. In order to reduce the costs, the membranes were reused. Prior to reuse, 100 mL of MilliQ water was circulated for 5 min and then collected. One membrane was dedicated to use for surface water samples and another membrane was strictly used for wastewater samples. Membranes were stored at 4 °C in 20% ethanol and reused for up to one year, if they passed the membrane integrity test. During the experiments the inlet flow was set to 1000–1680 mL/min with 5 psi (0.3447 bar) pressure to achieve a permeate flow of 200–300 mL/min. Filtration was continued until approx. 5 mL sample remained in the reservoir. Then the flow was set to 680 mL/min with no pressure applied and the concentrate was circulated for 5 min with the permeate clamp closed. In order to increase recovery, the membrane was backwashed using approx. 20 mL 0.01% sodium polyphosphate solution added through the permeate pressure valve. The concentrate was collected from the system by introducing air through the retentate port. The final volume of the concentrate was approx. 50 mL. The TFUF concentrates were further concentrated as described in Farkas et al. (2017a). Samples were mixed with beef extract and NaNO3 to reach a final concentration of 3% and 2 M, respectively. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 5.5 and the sample was incubated for 30 min and then the solid matter was removed by centrifugation at 2,500 ×g, 10 min. The pH of the eluent was adjusted to 7.5 and incubated in 15% polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG6000) and 2% NaCl overnight at 4 °C and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 2 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). The viral concentrates were stored at 4 °C for up to 24 h and then stored at −80 °C. The solutions derived from the last washing step prior to the reuse of the membranes during the TFUF concentrations were concentrated by incubation in 15% PEG6000 and 2% NaCl overnight at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The viral nucleic acids were extracted directly from the pellet. All wash samples derived from the validation experiments were analysed, and two randomly selected samples were processed during each sampling event of the surveillance experiment. Sediment samples were processed using beef extract elution (10 g sediment was mixed with 3× volume 3% beef extract in 2 M NaNO3, pH 5.5) followed by PEG precipitation as described above. Further details on the validation of this method are described in Farkas et al. (2017a). MgV was added to the samples as a whole process control. Enteric viruses were extracted from the digestive tissue of the mussels following the standard method ISO/TS 15216-1:2013. In brief, 2 g aliquot of digestive tissue derived from 20 individuals was spiked with MgV as an extraction control and then incubated in proteinase K solution for 60 min at 37 °C followed by 15 min at 60 °C. The liquid phase was separated using centrifugation. The viral eluents were stored at 4 °C for up to 24 h and then stored at −80 °C. Viral nucleic acids were extracted from a 0.5 mL aliquot of the viral concentrates immediately after concentration using the NucliSENS® MiniMag® Nucleic Acid Purification System (bioMérieux SA, France). The final volume of the nucleic acid solution was 0.1 mL. When nucleic acids were extracted from the pellet the lysis buffer was added directly to the precipitate. The RNA of NoVGI, NoVGII, HAV, HEV, SaVGI and MgV was quantified using two triplex TaqMan one-step qRT-PCR assays as described in Farkas et al. (2017b). Human AdV DNA was quantified using a SYBR Green qPCR assay. The reaction mix contained 1× QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR Mix with 10 pmol of the forward (CATGACTTTTGAGGTGGATC), 10 pmol of the reverse (CCGGCCGAGAAGGGTGTGCGCAGGTA) primers (van Maarseveen et al., 2010), and 1 μg bovine serum albumin (BSA). Amplification of the AdV target sequence was carried out using the following thermal cycling conditions: 95 °C for 5 min, then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 1 min. Amplification was followed by one cycle of melting curve analysis at 95 °C for 15 s; annealing 60 °C for 1 min. Dissociation was carried out from 60 °C to 95 °C with a temperature ramp of 0.05 °C/s. Analysis indicated a melting peak (Tm) at 86.2 °C ± 0.3 °C. Amplification with different melting temperature was considered negative. The JC and BK polyomavirus (JCV and BKV) were quantified using TaqMan qPCR assays as described in Chehadeh and Nampoory (2013). The q(RT)-PCR assays were carried out in a QuantStudio® Flex 6 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). For quantification, dilution series of a plasmid DNA carrying the target sequence were used. For all samples 2–8 μL of the original and a ten-times (vol:vol) diluted extract were tested. The viral concentrations were expressed as genome copies (gc)/L or gc/g. NoV capsid integrity was assayed using porcine gastric mucin-conjugated magnetic beads (PGM-MBs). This protein harbours the H1, A and Lewis b antigens, which are natural ligands for NoV particles (Cheetham et al., 2007; Tian et al., 2005). The mucin was covalently bonded to the beads using a two-step EDAC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride) - sulfo-NHS (N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide) method. A 0.5 mL aliquot of MagnaBind Carboxyl Derivatized Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) were washed three times with PBS and incubated in 10 mg/mL EDAC and 10 mg/mL sulfo-NHS in 50 mM 2-(4-morpholino)-ethane sulfonic acid (MES), 0.9% NaCl (pH 4.7) conjugation buffer for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were then resuspended in conjugation buffer containing 5 mg/mL PGM (M1778, Sigma, USA) and gently agitated at room temperature for 14 h. The coated beads were then washed three times with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 mL PBS. PGM-MBs were stored at 4 °C and used within 4 months. The concentrated surface water samples used in the spiking experiment (Section 2.1) were subjected to the PGM assay. A 0.1 mL aliquot of the samples was mixed with 370 μL PBS and 30 μL PGM-MGs for 30 min at room temperature. The PGM-MGs were separated using a magnetic bead attractor and then washed and resuspended in 0.5 mL PBS. The sample was then incubated at 96 °C for 5 min. The PGM-MGs were separated using a magnetic bead attractor and the viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant as described above. The final volume of the RNA solution was 50 μL. NoV RNA was quantified using qRT-PCR as described above. Viral concentrates that were positive for NoV were five-times diluted in PBS prior to evaluating capsid integrity assay. A 0.1 mL aliquot of those samples was subjected to the PGM-MG assay as described above. Test volume was increased 5× for low concentration samples. The limit of detection (LOD) of the processes were 25 gc/L in wastewater, 10 gc/L in surfaces water, 10 gc/g in sediment and 25 gc/g in shellfish. The limit of quantification (LOQ) of the processes was approx. 200 gc/L in wastewater and in surface water and 200 gc/g in sediment and in shellfish. Results below the LOD were considered ‘negative’ and samples with concentration below the LOQ were considered ‘detected’. Linear regression analysis was performed to estimate the relationship between the physico-chemical characteristics of water (pH, turbidity) and viral titres. These relationships were computed separately for the three source types: wastewater influents, effluents and surface waters. To assess the relationship between viral titres, a chi-square test was first carried out based on presence/absence, absence being identified with negative. Tests were carried out for source types both individually and combined. Correlations between viral titres were then computed, restricting the analysis to those samples with significant (i.e. non-negative/detected) counts, and using data from both individual and combined source types. We used a log10 transformation of all non-negative/detected virus counts in the statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using the R software version 3.3.2 (R Core Team, 2013). For method validation, treated and untreated wastewater samples were collected at the four WWTPs during a NoV outbreak that affected the area. As the viral concentration was expected to be high, these samples were not spiked with viruses but screened for human AdV, JCV, BKV, NoVGI/GII, SaVGI, HAV and HEV. High concentrations of AdV and JCV (104–6 × 105 gc/L) were noted in all samples (Fig. 2). High concentrations of BKV were found in samples derived from Ganol, Llanrwst and Tal-y-Bont, but BKV was not recovered from samples from Betws-y-Coed. The concentration of NoVGII was also extremely high in all samples and a low concentration of NoVGI was also noted. In the treated wastewater samples derived from the Ganol WWTP, a 0.3–1.7 log10 reduction in viral concentrations was observed. Little or no reduction was found in wastewater effluent from the other sites, relative to the influent. Indeed, in some instances the viral titre in the effluent was greater than observed in the influent. Seawater, estuarine water and river water samples, 10 L each in triplicate, were spiked with approx. 106 gc NoVGII, AdV type 40, SaVGI and MgV. The seawater and river water samples were also spiked with approx. 106 gc HAV. Overall, the viral recovery ranged from 12% to 115% with the lowest recoveries observed for SaVGI (12.0–38.5%) and NoV (12.5–57.1%) followed by HAV (22.4–110.7%), MgV (25.3–114.9%) and AdV (33.4–105.4%; Fig. 3). The concentrated water samples were assayed with PGM-MBs to enumerate intact viral particles. The recoveries for different water types varied between 50% and 105%, which were higher than the recoveries observed using direct nucleic acid extraction (Fig. 3). As a whole process control, MgV was added in known concentration to the samples prior to water concentration or the elution of viruses from sediment and shellfish, and recovery percentiles were determined (Table 1). Results showed that MgV could be efficiently recovered from the spiked samples. The wash samples collected between TFUF runs were all negative for the viruses tested suggesting no cross-contamination. To determine the efficiency of the PGM assay, the surface water samples spiked with enteric viruses were tested. Using the PGM assay, 62–100% recoveries were achieved (Fig. 3). To assess the rate of false positive results, concentrates considered negative were spiked with a known concentration of NoVGII RNA and the RNA was quantified after PGM treatment. The NoVGII RNA recovery was <0.01% suggesting very little or no RNA binding to the PGM-MBs. High titres of AdV and JCV were noted in all wastewater influent and effluent samples (Fig. 4; Table 2). In total, 90% of the wastewater influent samples contained AdV and the same number of positives was observed for JCV. Slightly higher concentrations were observed during spring (from March to June 2017) compared to the concentrations in the rest of the samples (Fig. S1A). For wastewater effluent, 87% and 90% of the samples were positive for AdV and JCV, respectively. No seasonal patterns were evident, however a few peaks were observed in the samples taken at Betws-y-Coed (Fig. S1C). High titres of AdV and JCV were noted in all wastewater influent and effluent samples (Fig. 4; Table 2). In total, 90% of the wastewater influent samples contained AdV and the same number of positives was observed for JCV. Slightly higher concentrations were observed during spring (from March to June 2017) compared to the concentrations in the rest of the samples (Fig. S1A). For wastewater effluent, 87% and 90% of the samples were positive for AdV and JCV, respectively. No seasonal patterns were evident, however a few peaks were observed in the samples taken at Betws-y-Coed (Fig. S1C). Lower abundance was observed for the RNA viruses studied. Overall, 35%, 62% and 27% of the influent samples and 38%, 49% and 10% of the effluent samples were positive for NoVGI, NoVGII and SaVGI, respectively. NoVGI peaked during the spring months (from March to May 2017), whereas two peaks in NoVGII concentrates were noted; one during October–December 2016 and another during the spring months (Fig. S1B, D). SaVGI was only detected between March and August 2017. The abundance and concentration of RNA viruses was much higher at the largest WWTP (Ganol) compared to the smaller treatment works. HAV and HEV were not detected in any of the samples. Lower abundance was observed for the RNA viruses studied. Overall, 35%, 62% and 27% of the influent samples and 38%, 49% and 10% of the effluent samples were positive for NoVGI, NoVGII and SaVGI, respectively. NoVGI peaked during the spring months (from March to May 2017), whereas two peaks in NoVGII concentrates were noted; one during October–December 2016 and another during the spring months (Fig. S1B, D). SaVGI was only detected between March and August 2017. The abundance and concentration of RNA viruses was much higher at the largest WWTP (Ganol) compared to the smaller treatment works. HAV and HEV were not detected in any of the samples. Overall, up to 2 log10 lower viral concentrations were noted in the effluent samples compared to the influent samples from all WWTPs. Of the 10 linear regressions between viral titres and pH or turbidity, (two source types; five viruses), a significant slope (p < 0.05) was only found for one turbidity relationship (NoVGII in wastewater influent) while no pH relationships were apparent. The chi-square tests based on presence and absence gave one significant (p < 0.05) result from 20 tests. There was some weak evidence of association between some viruses in WWTP effluent when both members of a pair were present in appreciable quantities. The pairs showing significant (p < 0.05) correlations were (NoVGI, SaVGI), (NoVGI, HAdV) and (AdV, JCV). For these water sources, the data showed little evidence of a relationship between viral titres and pH or turbidity, or between viral titres, once source type and location had been accounted for. Compared to the wastewater samples lower abundance and viral concentrations were observed in the surface water samples (Fig. 4 and Fig. S2). The viral concentrations observed in the surface water samples were 1–4 log10 lower than those observed for the wastewater samples. Most surface water samples contained AdV, however, fewer samples were positive for JCV (88% vs 65%). Interestingly, almost all SW3 samples were positive for JCV, whereas the JCV was less abundant in the other surface water samples (Fig. S2). The ratio of the samples positive for the RNA viruses was also low; 10%, 13% and 4% of the samples were positive for NoVGI, NoVGII and SaVGI, respectively. Noroviruses were present in the samples taken in September and November 2016 at SW1 and SW4, in January 2017 at SW2 and in February and May 2017 at SW1 and SW3. In general NoVGI concentrations exceeded the NoVGII concentration in the surface water samples. SaVGI was only present in samples taken at SW1 and SW2 in September 2016. HAV and HEV were not detected in any of the samples. No significant regression relationship was found between viral titres and either pH or turbidity. The chi-square test gave no significant (p < 0.05) test result, nor were there any significant correlations (p < 0.05) between viral titres. Compared to the wastewater samples lower abundance and viral concentrations were observed in the surface water samples (Fig. 4 and Fig. S2). The viral concentrations observed in the surface water samples were 1–4 log10 lower than those observed for the wastewater samples. Most surface water samples contained AdV, however, fewer samples were positive for JCV (88% vs 65%). Interestingly, almost all SW3 samples were positive for JCV, whereas the JCV was less abundant in the other surface water samples (Fig. S2). The ratio of the samples positive for the RNA viruses was also low; 10%, 13% and 4% of the samples were positive for NoVGI, NoVGII and SaVGI, respectively. Noroviruses were present in the samples taken in September and November 2016 at SW1 and SW4, in January 2017 at SW2 and in February and May 2017 at SW1 and SW3. In general NoVGI concentrations exceeded the NoVGII concentration in the surface water samples. SaVGI was only present in samples taken at SW1 and SW2 in September 2016. HAV and HEV were not detected in any of the samples. No significant regression relationship was found between viral titres and either pH or turbidity. The chi-square test gave no significant (p < 0.05) test result, nor were there any significant correlations (p < 0.05) between viral titres. In the sediment and shellfish samples, the proportion of samples positive for AdV was similar to the amount observed in the water samples (82% and 85% in sediment and shellfish samples, respectively), however, the abundances of the other target viruses were considerably lower (Fig. S3; Table 3). The abundance of JCV was lower than in the water samples, 38% of the sediment and 35% of the shellfish samples were positive. Interestingly, in sediment and shellfish samples, the NoVGI was more abundant than NoVGII (18% vs 8% in sediment and 19% vs 12% in shellfish samples). NoV concentrations peaked during September–November 2016 and January–March 2017 in the sediment and shellfish samples. All sediment and shellfish samples were negative for HAV, HEV and SaVGI. There were no significant chi-square test results or correlations between viral titres for these source materials. In the sediment and shellfish samples, the proportion of samples positive for AdV was similar to the amount observed in the water samples (82% and 85% in sediment and shellfish samples, respectively), however, the abundances of the other target viruses were considerably lower (Fig. S3; Table 3). The abundance of JCV was lower than in the water samples, 38% of the sediment and 35% of the shellfish samples were positive. Interestingly, in sediment and shellfish samples, the NoVGI was more abundant than NoVGII (18% vs 8% in sediment and 19% vs 12% in shellfish samples). NoV concentrations peaked during September–November 2016 and January–March 2017 in the sediment and shellfish samples. All sediment and shellfish samples were negative for HAV, HEV and SaVGI. There were no significant chi-square test results or correlations between viral titres for these source materials. A PGM assay was used to assess the viral capsid integrity in 43 concentrates positive for NoVGI and 54 concentrates positive for NoVGII. Results showed that the 83% of the wastewater influent samples were positive for NoVGI using the PGM assay and all influents were positive for NoVGII (Table 3). Fewer effluent samples were positive for NoVGI (57%), whereas 75% were positive for NoVGII. Few surface water and sediment samples were positive for NoV (0–25%) following the PGM assay. In general, the viral concentrations observed after PGM assay were lower than those observed following direct extraction (Table 3, Fig. S4). The only exception was the batch of wastewater influent samples tested for NoVGII; 19 samples of the 29 tested showed higher concentration of NoVGII by PGM assay than by direct extraction. A PGM assay was used to assess the viral capsid integrity in 43 concentrates positive for NoVGI and 54 concentrates positive for NoVGII. Results showed that the 83% of the wastewater influent samples were positive for NoVGI using the PGM assay and all influents were positive for NoVGII (Table 3). Fewer effluent samples were positive for NoVGI (57%), whereas 75% were positive for NoVGII. Few surface water and sediment samples were positive for NoV (0–25%) following the PGM assay.

The only exception was the batch of wastewater influent samples tested for NoVGII; 19 samples of the 29 tested showed higher concentration of NoVGII by PGM assay than by direct extraction. Considering the large number of food- and waterborne disease outbreaks associated with enteric viruses, a greater understanding of the fate and transport of these viruses in the environment from source to point of use is needed. The aim of this study was to investigate viral contamination at source (WWTPs) and in the receiving river and estuary, including treated and untreated wastewater, surface water, sediment and shellfish samples, over an annual cycle. The methods used for sample concentration and quantification were carefully validated, thus enabling the accurate estimation of viral titres. For the quantification of the viruses q(RT-)PCR was used, however, this approach does not address viral integrity and infectivity. Therefore, to evaluate viral degradation, a capsid integrity assay using PGM-MGs was also used. We targeted viruses that are commonly associated with waterborne and shellfish-borne outbreaks (NoVGI, NoVGII and HAV), emerging viruses that have been shown to be associated with outbreaks but rarely or not found in UK waters (SaV and HEV) and potential indicator viruses (AdV and PyV). Viral concentrations have been compared with the pH, turbidity and conductivity of the water samples, however, little or no correlation was found, most likely due to a small sample size. A more focused monitoring campaign would be necessary to accurately describe the potential correlations between physico-chemical properties and microbial quality. In this study we validated a two-step concentration method for the detection and quantification of viruses in surface water and wastewater. The method includes a TFUF step using a 100 kDa membrane to reduce sample volume of between 1 and 10 L to approx. 50 mL. TFUF has been widely used to concentrate a variety of microbial pathogens in water, e.g. Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Salmonella, Escherichia, Enterococci, Clostridium spp. together with viruses (Francy et al., 2013; Kahler et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2012). To assess cross-contamination between samples, the solutions used for the final wash step between experiments were also checked for enteric viruses. No viruses were detected in those solutions suggesting that the membranes can be reused. The second step of our concentration method involves a beef extract elution and a PEG precipitation. PEG precipitation has been used as a secondary concentration step following TFUF (Kahler et al., 2015). The elution step allowed the viral particles to detach from solid matter in the primary concentrate and hence improve the efficiency of the PEG precipitation. For viral detection and quantification, nucleic acids were extracted and quantified using q(RT-)PCR. For method validation, river, estuarine and seawater samples (10 L each) were spiked with a mix of viruses including NoVGII, SaVGI, HAV, AdV and MgV in triplicates. The recovery rates varied between 12 and 100% (Fig. 3) suggesting that the method is suitable for the recovery of viruses. Wastewater samples were not spiked with enteric viruses for method validation due to the high abundance of target viruses in wastewater. Instead, wastewater influent and effluent samples were collected at four locations during a NoV outbreak in the area. The high concentration of AdV, JCV, BKV and NoVGII agree with viral concentrations usually found in wastewater (Kitajima et al., 2014; Tran et al., 2015). Interestingly, BKV was only found in high concentrations in three out of four sites, suggesting it is less abundant than JCV or the other target enteric viruses. As the aim of the inclusion of polyomaviruses in this study was to find potential indicators for viral wastewater-derived contamination in the environment, BKV was excluded and only JCV was targeted during the surveillance experiment. Interestingly, in some cases, higher viral concentrations were observed in the treated effluent wastewater samples than in the corresponding untreated influent samples. The results were consistent in diluted nucleic acid extracts, hence inhibition during detection was unlikely. As the influent and effluent samples were taken at the same time, the variations in viral titres in effluent were probably due to the diurnal changes in wastewater quality. For the elution of viral particles from sediment and shellfish, established methods were used. The elution-concentration method used for sediment samples has been shown to sufficiently recover NoVGII, HAV, rotavirus and poliovirus from estuarine sediment (Farkas et al., 2017a; Lewis and Metcalf, 1988). For shellfish samples the ISO/TS15216-1 standard was used. This assay was developed for the quantification of RNA of NoVGI, NoVGII and HAV in shellfish digestive tissue and has been widely used by researchers and reference laboratories worldwide. For further validation of the methods and for quality control, all samples collected were spiked with a known concentration of MgV. Mengovirus was recovered in all samples with rates exceeding 10% (Table 1), which meets the quality control requirements of standardised methods. For instance, the ISO/TS15216-1 method used for the detection of enteric viruses in shellfish requires 1% recovery of the process control. The Method 1615 provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the concentration of environmental and drinking water samples for the quantification of enteric viruses allows 5–200% recoveries for the process control (Fout et al., 2010). Hence, the recovery achieved in this study and the usefulness of our method for difficult water samples suggests that the method can be standardised and used for routine monitoring. In this study, qPCR and qRT-PCR were used for the primary detection and quantification of the target viruses. As there is no culture-based assay that can be used for the monitoring of many enteric viruses, e.g. human NoV and SaV strains, q(RT-)PCR assays are the most frequently used techniques for the enumeration of pathogenic viruses in the environment. In order to assess viral infectivity, genome and capsid integrity assays have been established and in this study we evaluated the usefulness of a histo-blood group antigen affinity assay using PGM-MBs that have the ability to bind to NoV surface antigens (Dancho et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2008). The subsequent qRT-PCR therefore only detects RNA derived from intact viral particles. In order to validate the assay, the surface water concentrates spiked with NoVGII were tested using PGM-MBs. In all instances, higher recoveries (60–100%) were achieved using this assay than when direct extraction was used (Fig. 3) suggesting that the use of PGM eliminated some proportion of organic matter that inhibits nucleic acid extraction and qRT-PCR. This correlates with previous findings where a 1–2 log10 increased sensitivity was observed when using the PGM assay on food samples (Tian et al., 2008). Further validation using NoV RNA shows that the assay excludes free RNA. Hence, the PGM assay is suitable for the recovery of intact viruses and may be used as an additional purification step prior to RNA extraction when NoV is being monitored. During our surveillance of enteric viruses in wastewater and in the environment, no HAV or HEV were found. These strains are not abundant in the UK except for a few sporadic cases, and during this study no HAV- or HEV-illness was reported to the national public health agencies. High titres of NoVGI, NoVGII, SaVGI, AdV and JCV were found. The highest concentrations were found in wastewater influent and effluent samples. Viral titres, and the number of positive samples, significantly reduced in surface water, sediment and shellfish samples (Table 2). These viruses are frequently found in wastewater and surface water worldwide (Tran et al., 2015), however, to our knowledge, this is the first study detecting SaV in wastewater and river water in the UK. SaVGI was present in multiple wastewater influent and effluent samples over March–June 2017 at high concentrations and was detected at low concentrations in two river water samples in September 2016. No SaV-related outbreaks were reported during the period of this study. However, SaV-related symptoms are very similar to NoV symptoms and hence SaV-related illnesses may not be reported. SaVGI was not found in any of the sediment or shellfish samples that may suggest relatively rapid die-off in the environment. NoVGI and NoVGII were frequently found in all sample types throughout the study. In general, the highest NoVGII concentration was noted in November 2016 and peaks of NoVGI titres were observed during the spring months of 2017 in all sample types. These findings correlate well with the sporadic outbreaks noted in the monitoring area during October–December 2016 and February–May 2017 (Public Health Wales, personal communication). Similar correlations were found in a previous study on NoV titres in river water vs. gastroenteritis outbreaks in France (Prevost et al., 2015). The peak NoV concentrations varied between 105 and 107 gc/L in influent samples and the highest concentrations were noted in samples derived from the largest WWTP (Ganol). These findings agree with previously reported NoV concentrations (102–107 gc/L) in untreated wastewater (Grøndahl-Rosado et al., 2014; Kitajima et al., 2014; Rusiñol et al., 2015), however, higher NoV concentrations have also been noted (Gerba et al., 2017). The differences in viral titres at different sites may be due to the differences in population served, site size and weather conditions. Only a slight reduction was observed in the effluent samples. These results correlate with previous findings that suggested a 1–3 log10 reduction in enteric virus concentrations during wastewater treatment (Kitajima et al., 2014; Qiu et al., 2015). Considerably lower NoV abundance was observed in surface water samples with peaks of 103 gc/L and in most cases NoVGI was more abundant than NoVGII. Only a few sediment and shellfish samples were positive for NoV with concentrations up to 103 gc/g. Interestingly, more sediment and shellfish samples were positive for NoVGI than for NoVGII (Table 2). The high NoVGI concentrations and abundance suggest that NoVGI is more persistent in the environment than NoVGII. Previous studies show that even though NoVGII is the most prevalent genotype globally, NoVGI is frequently found in environmental water and in shellfish and associated with illnesses (Kageyama et al., 2004; Le Guyader et al., 2006; Maalouf et al., 2010; Pérez-Sautu et al., 2012). Furthermore, NoVGI has been found to be more persistent to wastewater treatment procedures, UV and chemical disinfection treatments than NoVGII (Duizer et al., 2004). These findings suggest NoVGI is more persistent in the environment than NoVGII, however comparative studies are needed to fully understand the differences in the behaviour of these genotypes in the environment. The NoV found in shellfish samples may pose a potential public health hazard. According to the microbiological classification of shellfish harvesting waters and marketing requirements for human consumption (EC directive 91/492) the two monitored shellfish harvesting areas are Class B sites and shellfish from these areas should be depurated before commercial sale. Nonetheless, the contaminated shellfish may cause illness in people consuming shellfish as viral titres take longer than those of bacteria to be reduced in shellfish (Dore and Lees, 1995). AdVs and PyVs have been proposed as a potential indicator for wastewater contamination (Bofill-Mas et al., 2006; Hewitt et al., 2013; Pina et al., 1998; Rachmadi et al., 2016). These viruses are usually carried asymptomatically within the human population and are frequently found in wastewater in high concentrations, and appear to be resistant to wastewater treatment. Their persistency and behaviour in the environment are assumed to be similar to those of pathogenic enteric viruses and hence reflects faecal contamination more accurately than traditional indicators, e.g. bacteriophages (Lin and Ganesh, 2013). Supporting previous findings mentioned above, our study also showed high abundance of these viruses in wastewater and in the environment. Overall, 87% of the samples were positive for AdV and 67% of the samples were positive for JCV (Table 1). Interestingly, while AdV was frequently found in all sample types, JCV was more prevalent in wastewater and less frequently found in surface water, sediment and shellfish. The only exception was SW3 (sampling point close to the discharge point of Llanrwst WWTP), where JCV was found in 12 of the 13 samples taken. These findings suggest that AdV may be more persistent in the environment and reflect the behaviour of persistent enteric viruses, whereas JCV may degrade more rapidly and its survival is more consistent with less stable pathogens. These findings correlate with previous results showing high AdV concentrations over a year in wastewater and surface water in Norway (Grøndahl-Rosado et al., 2014) and in Sweden (Rusiñol et al., 2014) and in a Mediterranean catchment (Rusiñol et al., 2015). No seasonal changes were observed in the concentration of AdV and JCV in any sample type except wastewater influent, where slightly higher concentrations were observed during spring-summer than during autumn-winter. The high number of viruses may be due to the greater number of tourist visitors to the area during the warmer months of the year, in agreement with previous research showing a positive correlation between the level of urbanisation and environmental AdV and JCV concentrations (Rusiñol et al., 2014). In general, we observed that high NoV and SaV concentrations tended to be associated with high AdV and JCV concentrations. However, it was very frequently the case that high AdV and JCV concentrations were associated with negative NoV and SAV results. Due to the high AdV and JCV titres in all sample types and the lack of seasonality, AdV and JCV may be a suitable microbial source tracking tool for assessing human wastewater contamination in the environment (Rusiñol et al., 2014) without representing specific pathogenic viruses. Due to the lack of reliable in vitro culturing method for NoV that can be routinely used, viral survival was assessed using a PGM-based capsid integrity assay. The assay has been shown to sufficiently distinguish NoVs with intact capsids in a range of matrices including water (Cannon and Vinjé, 2008) and fresh food products (Tian et al., 2008) and have been used to model viral inactivation (Kingsley et al., 2014; Li and Chen, 2015; Dancho et al., 2012). In our study, the wastewater, surface water and sediment samples positive for NoV when direct extraction was used were assayed using PGM-MBs. The shellfish samples were not suitable for the assay as they were pre-treated with proteinase K for virus elution and the enzyme will degrade viral proteins in the samples. The results of the PGM assay suggested little viral degradation in the wastewater influent samples. In the majority of the samples, higher NoVGII concentrations were observed with the PGM assay than without it (Fig. S4), suggesting that the assay is suitable for removing inhibitors as shown elsewhere (Tian et al., 2008). In contrast, lower concentrations of NoVGI were detected when the PGM assay was used compared to direct extraction in all sample types including wastewater influents. This may indicate that the NoVGI strains found in the environment may have a different binding affinity to PGM. This theory is supported by the study of Hutson et al. (2004) that revealed strain-dependent differences in the binding pattern of NoV to antigens present in PGM. Furthermore, previous studies also observed that NoVGI have lower binding affinity to PGM than NoVGII (Tian et al., 2010). Due to the lack of reliable in vitro culturing method for NoV that can be routinely used, viral survival was assessed using a PGM-based capsid integrity assay. The assay has been shown to sufficiently distinguish NoVs with intact capsids in a range of matrices including water (Cannon and Vinjé, 2008) and fresh food products (Tian et al., 2008) and have been used to model viral inactivation (Kingsley et al., 2014; Li and Chen, 2015; Dancho et al., 2012). In our study, the wastewater, surface water and sediment samples positive for NoV when direct extraction was used were assayed using PGM-MBs. The shellfish samples were not suitable for the assay as they were pre-treated with proteinase K for virus elution and the enzyme will degrade viral proteins in the samples. The results of the PGM assay suggested little viral degradation in the wastewater influent samples. In the majority of the samples, higher NoVGII concentrations were observed with the PGM assay than without it (Fig. S4), suggesting that the assay is suitable for removing inhibitors as shown elsewhere (Tian et al., 2008). In contrast, lower concentrations of NoVGI were detected when the PGM assay was used compared to direct extraction in all sample types including wastewater influents. This may indicate that the NoVGI strains found in the environment may have a different binding affinity to PGM. This theory is supported by the study of Hutson et al. (2004) that revealed strain-dependent differences in the binding pattern of NoV to antigens present in PGM. Furthermore, previous studies also observed that NoVGI have lower binding affinity to PGM than NoVGII (Tian et al., 2010). The number of positive samples, as well as the viral concentrations, was slightly lower in wastewater effluent samples when the PGM assay was used suggesting limited viral degradation in the samples. A few surface water and sediment samples were also positive with the PGM assay for both NoVGI and NoVGII confirming viral degradation in the environment. Nonetheless, the positive samples indicate a potential public health threat and the presence and concentration of intact pathogenic viruses needs to be further investigated. The PGM assay is a rapid and simple method for the extraction of NoV particles from environmental samples. However, it may also detect semi-degraded viral particles (i.e. RNA attached to decayed capsid) and hence further validation is needed. Recently an in vitro human NoV culture method has been established using stem cell-derived human enteroids (Ettayebi et al., 2016) and that assay may be suitable for the validation of capsid integrity assays. Nonetheless, our results show that the PGM assay provides a more accurate estimation on viral titres than direct extraction and hence public health risks associated with waterborne and foodborne NoV can be better estimated. The methods validated in this study are suitable for the identification, quantification and surveillance of viruses in the aquatic environment. The surveillance revealed that high titres of intact and potentially infectious enteric viruses enter the environment via wastewater discharge. Viral titres correlate with outbreaks affecting the population of the study area. An emerging pathogen (SaV) was detected and quantified for the first time in UK waters along with indicator viruses (AdV and JCV) that inform on the spread of wastewater-associated pathogens in the environment. Furthermore, the survival of NoVs has also been assessed. However, further research is needed to discover the strain-related differences in viral persistence. The data can be applied to inform predictive models for the transport of enteric viruses in water and to improve current viral risk assessment.

These cosmic rays are composed of fully-ionized atomic nuclei from both solar and extrasolar sources, with energies ranging from ∼106 eV to beyond 1013 eV (Bazilevskaya et al., 2008). Beyond the penetration depth of solar EUV and X-ray particles, cosmic rays are typically the primary ionization source in a planetary atmosphere, as is the case in the terrestrial atmosphere below 60–70 km (Velinov et al., 2009) and in the venusian atmosphere below ∼100 km (Borucki et al., 1982). Cosmic rays are divided into two categories, galactic cosmic rays (GCR), which are believed to be produced by diffusive shock acceleration at the outer edges of expanding supernova remnants (Blandford and Eichler, 1987; Hillas, 2005) and solar energetic particles (SEP) which are produced by solar flares, coronal mass ejections and in interplanetary shocks (Reames, 1999). While the flux at the peak of the GCR spectrum (∼500 MeV/nucleon) is about four orders lower in magnitude than the corresponding SEP flux, the GCR spectrum extends to extremely large energies (>1013 eV) at very low fluxes, and the SEP spectrum drops off very sharply beyond ∼100 MeV/nucleon. Furthermore, while the GCR background is continuous and anticorrelated with the solar activity cycle due to heliospheric modulation, SEP events are sporadic in nature and positively correlated with increasing solar activity (Vainio et al., 2009). The GCR spectrum is composed of protons (∼87%) and alpha particles (∼12%), with a small contribution from fully ionized heavy nuclei (∼1%) (Simpson, 1983). The shape and composition of the SEP spectrum varies significantly between SEP events (Reames, 1999; Schmelz et al., 2012). While low energy CR particles lose energy to atmospheric neutrals by elastic collisions, ionization and excitation before being effectively stopped and absorbed, those primary particles with energies above ∼1 GeV initiate extensive cascades of secondary particles. When such a particle undergoes an inelastic collision with an atmospheric nucleus, secondary mesons (pions and kaons), nucleons, gamma particles and nuclear fragments are created, which may in turn interact with other atmospheric nuclei, creating an atmospheric particle cascade (“air shower”) as illustrated in Fig. 1. Secondary mesons decay almost instantly to produce muons, gamma particles and electrons. Therefore, a fully developed air shower is composed of a hadronic core consisting of nuclear fragments, protons and neutrons, surrounded by a spreading cone of muons (the “hard component”) and electrons, positrons and photons (the electromagnetic or “soft component”) (Bazilevskaya et al., 2008). The flux of secondary particles increases with depth until the Pfotzer maximum (Pfotzer, 1936), after which the average energy of the secondary particles is insufficient to produce additional particles and the flux steadily decays. The Pfotzer maximum coincides with the peak in CR ionization, and in the terrestrial atmosphere typically occurs at 16–25 km depending on location and solar activity levels (Bazilevskaya and Svirzhevskaya, 1998). As opposed to the terrestrial case, Venus does not possess a global magnetic field capable of deflecting charged particles, and so even low energy CR primaries have unimpeded access to the atmosphere. It is also closer to the Sun, and is therefore exposed to higher particle fluxes from sporadic SEP events (e.g. flares, coronal mass ejections). Furthermore, the venusian atmosphere is significantly more dense than that of the Earth, with a total shielding depth of ∼105 g/cm2 compared to the terrestrial value of ∼103 g/cm2, and an atmospheric density at the surface over an order of magnitude greater than at terrestrial sea level. The consequence is that cosmic ray air showers develop extensively in the venusian atmosphere, whereas many secondary particles reach, and are absorbed by the terrestrial surface. As cosmic rays represent a major ionization source in planetary atmospheres, the CR ionization rates have a strong influence on fundamental atmospheric properties such as electrical conductivity, atmospheric chemistry and charging of cloud particles (Aplin, 2013). It is therefore important to quantify the effects of cosmic ray ionization, and to understand its variability over both long and short time scales (i.e. solar cycle, SEP events). Cosmic ray ionization in the venusian atmosphere has not been extensively modeled in the past, with only three studies in the literature (Dubach et al., 1974; Borucki et al., 1982; Upadhyay and Singh, 1995; Upadhyay et al., 1994). Common to these is that they have made use of approximate transport equations to describe particle propagation within the atmosphere. Such methods employ simplifications that generally do not take into account the full range of effects from the interactions of primary and secondary air shower components with atmospheric neutrals, and are known to produce unreliable results in the lower terrestrial atmosphere (Bazilevskaya et al., 2008). This is the first study to carry out a full 3D Monte Carlo modeling of cosmic ray interactions within the venusian atmosphere, including discrete particle interactions within the extensive showers of secondary particles. Furthermore, we have implemented complete SEP and GCR primary spectra, taking into account the contribution from protons, alpha particles and heavier ions (Z = 3–28). For this modeling study we have used the PLANETOCOSMICS (http://cosray.unibe.ch/~laurent/planetocosmics/) software application (Desorgher et al., 2005), which is based on the Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit for particle interactions with matter (Agostinelli et al., 2003) and was developed at the University of Bern for the European Space Agency. PLANETOCOSMICS simulates discrete electromagnetic and hadronic particle interactions in planetary atmospheres, including a full treatment of secondary particle cascades, and has been validated against terrestrial balloon measurements (Desorgher et al., 2005; Vainio et al., 2009). For hadronic interactions, PLANETOCOSMICS uses the Geant4 Binary Intranuclear Cascade (BIC) model at energies <10 GeV/nucleon and a Quark Gluon String Precompound (QGSP) model at higher energies. For this modeling study, the simulation geometry was constructed as an atmospheric column 150 km high, implementing a model of representative temperature, pressure and density for the venusian atmosphere (Fig. 2). The width of the column is arbitrarily large, and was chosen such that it would be possible to track the entire atmospheric cascade without particles exiting through the sides. The atmospheric description is based on the Venus International Reference Atmosphere (Kliore et al., 1985), using the tabulated parameters of Seiff et al. (1985) for the middle and lower atmosphere (100–0 km) at low latitudes (φ < 30°) and those of Keating et al. (1985) for the daytime upper atmosphere between 100–150 km at low latitude (φ = 16°). An atmospheric composition of 96.5% CO2 and 3.5% N2 was used. The irradiation geometry of an isotropic hemispherical source above the planetary atmosphere is recreated by a point source at the top of the atmosphere delivering primary cosmic ray particles according to a cosine law angular distribution. All primary and secondary particles are tracked until they either come to rest within the atmospheric column or are absorbed by the planetary surface. The spectrum of primary cosmic ray particles was taken from the CREME2009 (https://creme.isde.vanderbilt.edu/) model (Tylka et al., 1997), which provides fluxes of Z = 1–28 (protons to nickel) ions from ∼1 MeV/nucleon up to 100 GeV/nucleon in interplanetary space at 1 AU. The GCR component of the CREME2009 model is based on the International Standard Galactic Cosmic Ray Model of the International Organization for Standardization [ISO 15390:2004(E)] (Nymmik, 2006), with additional extensions, including treatment of anomalous cosmic rays at low energies (Tylka et al., 1997). The GCR primary spectrum was extracted from CREME2009 for “solar quiet” conditions at solar maximum and minimum, which represent ambient conditions in the absence of solar energetic particle events. A power law tail was fitted to the flux spectrum for each Z species and used to extrapolate the GCR spectrum up to 1 TeV/nucleon. As the gradient of GCR flux is very low within the inner Solar System (Fujii and McDonald, 1997; Morales-Olivares and Caballero-Lopez, 2010), rescaling of the CREME2009 GCR fluxes to the orbit of Venus is not necessary. In order to illustrate the effects of a particularly strong SEP event on atmospheric ionization, the SEP primary spectrum was extracted from the CREME2009 model during “flare” conditions corresponding to a series of severe SEP events that occurred in October, 1989. Unlike GCR, the flux of SEP received from a solar event depends significantly on the orbital distance, and so the SEP fluxes were scaled to the mean orbit of Venus (0.72 AU) using a geometric (1/R2) factor. The modeled GCR and SEP spectra are shown in Fig. 3, with the dominant ion species (H, He, C, O, Si and Fe) highlighted. For both SEP and GCR, the cosmic ray spectrum was implemented by explicitly simulating He, C, O, Si and Fe primaries up to 10 GeV/nucleon – the energy limit of Geant4 light ion (Z > 1) physics, while primary H ions were simulated up to 1 TeV. To provide an approximation for the energy contribution of the heavier ions (Z > 1) above 10 GeV/nucleon, the H data was weighted by energy integration to account for the contribution of all species Z = 1–28 from 10 GeV/nucleon to 1 TeV/nucleon. Below 10 GeV/nucleon, the data from the H, He, C, O, Si and Fe primaries were weighted to account for the energy carried by all species Z = 1–28. In total, these six species account for ∼97% of the energy in the cosmic ray spectrum, and thus we have explicitly simulated the most important components of the cosmic ray spectrum while accounting for the energy delivered by all primary ions from Z = 1–28 from 1 MeV/nucleon to 1 TeV/nucleon. Energy deposition by all primary and secondary cosmic ray particles is recorded in each geometry layer and from this, the total energy deposition versus altitude is computed. The ionization rate at a given altitude is calculated by considering the total deposited dose, the atmospheric density at this altitude and a mean ionization potential (W) for the venusian atmosphere of 33.5 eV to create one ion–electron pair in CO2 (Borucki et al., 1982), which is consistent with theoretical (e.g. Fox et al., 2008) and experimental estimates (International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements, 1993). Fig. 4 shows the resulting ionization rate due to GCR at solar minimum (left), compared to previous results by Dubach et al. (1974) and Borucki et al. (1982) (right), which for energies lower than 10 GeV used a primary spectrum recorded in 1963, near solar minimum (Freier and Waddington, 1965). Also shown are the results of Upadhyay and Singh (1995), for which the modeled solar conditions are not clearly stated. However, as solar minimum represents the GCR maximum, we may consider this an upper bound with which to compare their results. Our results show an ionization peak of 58 ion pairs cm−3 s−1 at 62.5 km. The work of Borucki et al. (1982) shows an ionization peak that is ∼18% greater than this study and occurs at 63–64 km. The work of Dubach et al. (1974) shows an ionization peak that is ∼15% lower in magnitude than the present study, but occurring at a similar altitude of 63 km. Although a full comparison is not possible, as these studies do not have the same coverage in altitude, we observe that significantly above the ionization peak, the other two studies underestimate the ionization rates by 50% or more at 80 km. Although the analytical approximation utilized by these two studies agrees quite well with our results near the ionization peak, Borucki et al. (1982) estimates higher ionization rates in the lower atmosphere by as much as an order of magnitude at ground level. The study by Upadhyay and Singh (1995) similarly makes use of an approximate solution to treat particle propagation in the atmosphere. However, their study estimates ionization rates that are over an order of magnitude greater than the other studies at all altitudes, with an ionization peak at 64 km on the order of 103 ion pairs cm−3 s−1. Furthermore, they predict a second ionization peak near ∼25 km due to the influence of muons, a feature that is not observed in the results of the other studies. Their predicted ionization rate due to cosmic rays near the venusian surface is over 5 orders of magnitude greater than what is predicted by the present study. In summary, our results are in general agreement with the previous studies of Dubach et al. (1974) and Borucki et al. (1982), but presents several important advances, particularly in the upper and lower atmosphere. At solar maximum (Fig. 5) we observe that the ionization peak occurs at the same altitude of 62.5 km, however the ionization rate is reduced to 46 ion pairs cm−3 s−1. Above ∼80 km, the ionization rates are reduced to ∼40% of the solar minimum values. These changes can be explained by the fact that the average GCR spectrum at solar maximum is significantly softer below about 10 GeV/nucleon compared to the average GCR spectrum at solar minimum. Similarly, the ionization rates below ∼50 km are practically identical due to the fact that only the most energetic (> a few GeV/nucleon) component of the GCR spectrum is capable of reaching large atmospheric depths. At such high energy the GCR spectrum is not significantly modulated by solar activity. During transient SEP events, particle fluxes at the top of the atmosphere may be many orders of magnitude above background levels during “quiet” conditions. However, the shape of the SEP spectrum is typically very steep, and thus, the enhanced particle flux occurs mainly below ∼a few GeV/nucleon, with negligible fluxes beyond 100 GeV/nucleon. To investigate what effects such intense but short-lived particle enhancements may have on the venusian atmosphere, we have used measured spectra from an SEP event that occurred in October, 1989 – one of the most intense SEP events observed during the space age (Miroshnichenko et al., 2000). The “worst week” scenario corresponds to particle fluxes averaged over 180 h beginning at 1300 UTC on the 19th of October 1989, while the “peak” scenario corresponds to the peak five-minute averaged fluxes as observed by the GOES spacecraft on October 20th, 1989 (Tylka et al., 1997). Figs. 6 and 7 show the atmospheric ionization rates produced by these two scenarios. In the case of the “worst week” scenario, the ionization peak occurs at ∼95 km, with ionization rates of ∼7 × 103 ion pairs cm−3 s−1, an enhancement of over 5 orders of magnitude compared to the average background rate due to GCR at solar minimum. However, the ionization rate due to SEP near the GCR peak is of comparable magnitude to the average GCR contribution, thus, we would expect to see an effective doubling of the ionization rate at this altitude. For the “peak” scenario, the ionization peak also occurs at ∼95 km, but ionization rates at the peak are even greater, at ∼1.6 × 105 ion pairs cm−3 s−1, over 6 orders of magnitude above GCR background levels. The ionization rate due to SEP near 63 km is over an order of magnitude greater than the contribution from the GCR peak. While the results presented herein are computed for average conditions on the low-latitude venusian dayside, any specific atmospheric and cosmic ray conditions can be simulated by our model. This is particularly relevant for comparisons with in-situ atmospheric measurements by future missions to Venus. The interaction of SEP and GCR particles with the venusian atmosphere has been modeled for the first time using a full 3D treatment of discrete primary and secondary particle interactions. Near the ionization peak, the results for GCR conditions at solar minimum are similar to those of Dubach et al. (1974) and Borucki et al. (1982), which make use of approximate solutions to the Boltzmann transport equation (O’Brien, 1971). The reported ionization rates above the ionization peak are significantly lower than what is seen in the present study. However, these studies did not explicitly simulate primary particles of Z > 1, and it has been shown that the contribution from the High Z component of the GCR spectrum is significant at high altitudes on Titan and Earth (Gronoff et al., 2011; Velinov and Mateev, 2008). In addition, Borucki et al. (1982) estimates higher ionization rates in the lower atmosphere by as much as an order of magnitude at ground level. Whereas our study models the discrete interactions in the air shower, Borucki et al. (1982) makes use of an analytical approximation for the atmospheric cascade (Capone et al., 1979; O’Brien, 1971), which is known to be less reliable at large atmospheric depths, where the air shower is more fully developed and the “hard” (muon) component dominates (Bazilevskaya et al., 2008). We find that the predicted cosmic ray ionization rates of Upadhyay and Singh (1995) significantly disagree with the other studies at all altitudes. It is worth noting that recent theoretical work by Simon Wedlund et al. (2011) suggests a new value for the ionization potential W for CO2-dominated atmospheres that is slightly lower than the values reported by previous theoretical and experimental studies. If indeed this is confirmed by further investigations and the consensus regarding the correct value of W changes, the ionization profiles presented herein may simply be re-scaled to reflect this difference. As illustrated in Fig. 8, cosmic rays due to SEP and GCR are the dominant source of atmospheric ionization in the middle and lower venusian atmosphere (below ∼100 km). The predicted daytime EUV/X-ray ionization rates of Peter et al. (2014) for low solar zenith angles (χ = 23.1°) are shown for comparison and can be seen to peak at a much higher altitude of 140 km. Based on density scaling, (Borucki et al., 1982) estimated that atmospheric ionization due to decay of radioactive minerals is confined to within ∼100 m of the surface. By comparing the measured abundance of radioactive elements on the surface made by Venera 8 (Vinogradov, 1973) with that of terrestrial granites, (Aplin, 2006) estimates an atmospheric ionization rate in this near-surface layer of ∼0.01 ion pairs cm−3 s−1. While this is comparable to the atmospheric ionization rate at the surface due to cosmic rays reported by Borucki et al. (1982), we find that near the surface, the predicted ionization rates due to radioactive decay are roughly an order of magnitude greater than that due to cosmic rays. Atmospheric ionization due to cosmic rays is a fundamental process, and the results of the present study are relevant to a wide range of interdisciplinary topics within Venus atmospheric research. In a dense planetary atmosphere, such as that of Venus, ions and electrons produced by cosmic rays will interact rapidly with atmospheric neutrals to produce secondary ions and ion clusters. The atmospheric conductivity is governed by the mobility of these long-lived secondary species, whose lifetimes are limited by their recombination rates with ions of opposite charge and by attachment to aerosol particles (Borucki et al., 1982). While the atmospheric electron concentration (and thus the conductivity) has been measured down to ∼120 km in the venusian atmosphere (Brace et al., 1997), only theoretical estimates (Borucki et al., 1982; Michael et al., 2009) based on the predicted cosmic ray ionization rates of Borucki et al. (1982) are available below this altitude. Venus possesses several global layers of clouds and haze, which consist primarily of sulfuric acid and extend from ∼30–90 km, with the main cloud deck located at ∼45–70 km (Mills et al., 2013). Cloud particles may become charged by electron attachment and charge transfer with positive and negative ions, thus constituting a loss mechanism for atmospheric ions and electrons. Work by Michael et al. (2009) estimates that ion loss due to the presence of cloud particles leads to a reduction in the global atmospheric conductivity of a factor of 2–6. While it is not clear if Venus has a global electric circuit, preliminary calculations seem to indicate this is plausible (Aplin, 2013). By utilizing the updated ionization profiles provided by the present study, new estimates may be made of venusian atmospheric conductivity and the possibility of a global electric circuit may be re-assessed. The large atmospheric pressure at the surface and the high altitude of the cloud layer seems to exclude the possibility of cloud-to-ground lightning (Aplin, 2006; Gurnett et al., 2001), however, several authors have suggested that lightning discharges above, between or within clouds may occur (Borucki, 1982; Gurnett et al., 2001; Russell and Scarf, 1990). While positive detections of radio wave emissions due to venusian lightning have been reported (Ksanfomaliti et al., 1979; Russell et al., 2007; Taylor et al., 1979), radio observations by Cassini during two close flybys has not confirmed this and a lack of optical detections by Venus Express as well as ground-based observers leaves the question of venusian lightning unresolved (Yair, 2012; Yair et al., 2008). Lightning in the venusian atmosphere may be inferred by searching for Schumann resonances, Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) waves which are excited by electrical discharges within the surface-ionosphere cavity (Aplin et al., 2008; Simões et al., 2008b). The predicted signatures of such ELF waves within the venusian surface-ionosphere cavity has been studied theoretically by Simões et al. (2008a) by incorporating the conductivity profile produced by the cosmic ray modeling work of Borucki et al. (1982). While the exact mechanisms for charging within the venusian clouds is not known (Yair, 2012), it is clear that it is crucial to accurately quantify rates of cosmic ray ionization, as this is the primary ionization source at these altitudes. As such, the results of the present study serves as a fundamental input into future attempts at modeling cloud charging and lightning within the venusian atmosphere. It has also been suggested that aerosols may form by direct condensation of gaseous sulfuric acid onto ions in the lower atmosphere within the lower cloud-forming regions at ∼40 km (Aplin, 2013, 2006). Thus, it is possible that ionization by cosmic rays within the deep atmosphere may contribute to cloud formation on Venus. However, as shown in Fig. 8, there is little variability in cosmic ray ionization rates at this altitude between GCR solar minimum and maximum conditions, and the effects of SEP events at such large atmospheric depths are negligible. It therefore seems unlikely that any variability in SEP or GCR conditions will influence cloud formation rates at this altitude. Large electron density variations induced by sporadic SEP events may also affect radio wave propagation in the venusian atmosphere. At Mars, the Mars Express Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) instrument has experienced sporadic blackouts (Withers, 2011) and recent modeling by Norman et al. (2014) suggests that enhanced ionization due to SEP events is a plausible culprit. As we have shown that very large enhancements in the ion production rate within the atmosphere of Venus may occur during strong SEP events, this is an effect that should be considered for future missions to Venus, particularly those carrying low-frequency radar instruments. We have provided updated cosmic ray ionization profiles for the venusian atmosphere, using for the first time a full 3D Monte Carlo modeling approach taking into account the complete GCR spectrum between 1 MeV/nucleon–1 TeV/nucleon and Z = 1–28. While our results are comparable to those of previous studies (Borucki et al., 1982; Dubach et al., 1974) near the ionization peak located at ∼63 km, our results are significantly different above and below this altitude. We have also evaluated the influence that sporadic SEP events may have on atmospheric ionization rates, with enhancements of up to 6 orders of magnitude in the upper atmosphere and an order of magnitude near the GCR ionization peak. As GCR and SEP cosmic rays dominate ionization below ∼100 km altitude in the venusian atmosphere, the rate of cosmic ray-induced ionization directly affects properties such as atmospheric electrical conductivity, cloud charging and atmospheric electrical processes, possibly including lightning. The results of the present study serves as the basis for currently ongoing investigations into venusian atmospheric conductivity and electrical phenomena. Through the process of ion-induced nucleation of sulfuric acid onto ions, it is plausible that cosmic ray-induced ionization may influence cloud formation in the venusian atmosphere (Aplin, 2013, 2006). However, this process is predicted to operate near ∼40 km, where we have shown that the variability in ionization rate due to changing SEP and GCR conditions is minimal. Thus we do not expect that different cosmic ray conditions would have a strong influence on cloud formation rates due to ion-induced nucleation. On the other hand, it’s interesting to note that the peak in GCR ionization occurs within the main cloud deck near ∼60 km, and that transient SEP events may enhance ionization rates at this altitude by over an order of magnitude. It therefore seems plausible that such pronounced short-term variability may influence chemical and electrical processes that operate within this region.']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":33}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def del_attr(example):\n","  return example.pop('text')\n","\n","dataset =
