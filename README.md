# TorchNLP-Notes

This repo is a collection of my notes on all things related to Natural Language Processing and PyTorch implementation.
As only a beginner of PyTorch myself, the contents of the repo heavily depends on external resources. Conveniently, it can be thought of an curated notes based on my learning. 

## Resources 

- [Deep Learning with PyTorch Step-by-Step by Daniel Godoy](https://github.com/dvgodoy/PyTorchStepByStep)


## Learning Objectives

As a researcher in Applied Linguistics (focusing on Language Assessment and Corpus linguistics), my learning goals centers on application of Neural Network models into my research contexts. Specifically, these includes:

- [ ] Understanding how PyTorch works and how to train a basic NN model
- [ ] Fine-tuning Transformer models through PyTorch and Huggingface
- [ ] Reimplementing some cool NLP architectures
- [ ] Creating custom language components (for a applied language tasks) with AllenNLP and/or spaCy

More specifically, my learning objectives covers:
- [ ] Reimplementing [Transformer-SRL package](https://github.com/Riccorl/transformer-srl) with spaCy version 3
- [ ] Understand spaCy [SpanCategorizer](https://spacy.io/api/spancategorizer/#_title) and train the pipeline with relatively small hand-annotated data
- [ ] Domain adaptation of BERT and RoBERTa model to general academic English
